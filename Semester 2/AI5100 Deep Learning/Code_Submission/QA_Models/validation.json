tipping 20 is standard and acceptable at any hair salon if you re in a smaller town 15 may be the norm you can always ask the receptionist at your salon what s typical or ask on the phone when you call to make your appointment offering the person who shampoo your hair 3 to 5 is a nice gesture you can hand the money directly to the shampooist or give it to the receptionist when you check out and ask them to pas it along a for your stylist s assistant that person is likely in training and may not be making much money so michelle lee master designer and manager at salon eva michelle in boston recommends tipping them between 5 and 20 all the assistant are there in training to be stylist and at many place a lot are working at minimum wage so anywhere from 5 to 20 is fine depending on how much they end up doing for the client or if they have been especially gracious to you she told instyle try to bring cash to tip if possible not every credit card machine will allow you to add a tip and using cash will make it easier to tip the different people who worked on your mane and yes it s ok to tip even if your hairdresser is the owner of the salon also if your salon offer free bang

service stylist are split on the issue with some suggesting a 20 tip on the original price of the service and others saying a tip of 20 on the discounted rate is fine since the goal is to get you back into the salon when in doubt ask at the front desk finally if you re unsatisfied with your haircut communicated what you wanted to your stylist and talked to them about how to fix it but they refused

explains what halloween used to mean for him what are you up to today rickman i m in new york i m just here for three or four day for cbgb in new york and then back to work in england grint i m rehearsing a play that will start in london in a couple of week yeah so that s it are you enjoying the theater work are you more of a theater guy or a film guy grint i don t know really this is my first theater experience and it s very different i wanted to just try it it s something i ve always wanted to do just the thought of it scare me i ve kind of put it off for a long time and i just thought it wa a good time to do it and it s a great play and a really great cast with a great director and it wa just yeah i m enjoying it were you familiar with the legacy of cbgb a a breeding ground for the punk rock scene prior to taking your role in the movie rickman i wasn t familiar with cbgb at all i didn t know about it and didn t know it history i hadn t even really heard those four letter put together because at that time i wa very much in england a a drama student and an art student so it s all been a new discovery to me obviously i wa aware of some of the band but not that they d all started in a club on the bowery grint i didn t actually know a lot about it i d obviously heard of the name and the logo and seen it on t shirt and stuff like that but i didn t really know how prolific it wa in discovering some of my favorite band i love talking head and the whole punk thing wa something i really loved so yeah it wa quite an education learning about it and also dead boy i wasn t really familiar with them and kind of listening and watching them on youtube wa amazing they just had so much energy and they were just disgusting it wa incredible did you grow up listening to the music depicted in the movie rickman obviously i wa aware of the huge rise of the police in england and a an art student i wa very much a fan of talking head and then blondie but i wasn t a hard punk rock fan at the time but of course i wa also very much around the height of the beatles and the stone so it wa like that wa the lone star and everything spun off from there and bob dylan very much so england in the 60 and the 70 wa everything that history ha said it wa phenomenally exciting musically one wa very shaped by that grint it wa that whole era that i liked i like obviously the sex pistol and the clash blondie a well and the ramones some amazing people performed on that stage i went through a real punk phase not that long ago and yeah it wa probably the reason why i decided to do it because i have such a love for that did you dress similarly to the character that you play at any point grint laugh no not at all the dog collar wa a new experience for me not knowing much of the mythology of cbgb how did you come to learn about your character rickman what i really enjoyed and what made it interesting to play wa the fact that he happened in direct contrast to the world of the club and what it history became because there wa this big quiet contained man who made a club for country music and it never ever played there along came punk and he became like that deus ex machina i suppose i watched old interview and dvd i listened to him talking to his mother and his daughter and journalist so there wa a lot of material for me grint yeah there wasn t really a whole lot to go on there are a few video of him playing live at cbgb and a few interview i watched yeah and having dead boy guitarist cheetah chrome on set wa quite a different thing i had kind of a little bit of pressure because he wa kind of watching every scene and you re trying to portray him and do him justice and it s quite a challenge so he wa on set the whole time grint yeah he ha a cameo he play the cab driver he wa lovely he wa such a nice guy i wa kind of surprised he wa still alive did he give you any note while filming grint not so much note it wa just kind of watching him and being around him and listening to his story and just listening really kind of absorbing a lot of that and he wa such a nice guy and we had a good time wa this movie your first instance of nudity on camera grint yeah i guess it wa yeah were you comfortable with that how did that go down grint weirdly yeah it didn t really feel that big a deal it just kind of happened i didn t really think about it when i wa getting ready for it and yeah it just kind of happened i had some sort of sock modesty thing contraption i don t want to go into too much detail and yeah it wa just sort of one of those thing there wa quite a lot of that in the film especially from justin bartha a well there s quite a lot of as in the film you had to try out an american accent in this role is there an accent out there that you d be intimidated to have to use on camera rickman i think every english actor is nervous of a newcastle accent that s really difficult grint it s quite fun just trying to work on it and get it right i like that kind of challenge a couple year ago i did a film that required me to do a liverpool accent i don t know if you re familiar with that sound but that wa quite a hard one it s quite a harsh sound but i enjoy that side of thing once you started exploring the role and got into the dead boy and their history did you find yourself enjoying their music what did you think of the band you were portraying grint i really love them i listened to all their song completely their song are quite hard to play not easy to listen to but no i really love then i ve always really wanted to be in a band so this wa kind of an opportunity to experience that to go on stage and have the whole crowd there and the music is music something you d ever pursue grint i don t know probably not i ve tried to leverage it but i just know it s never going to happen alan you often play very dominant role very powerful people what were your thought going into a character who wa much more loose goosey is it fun to shift gear and play that sort of character rickman i suppose in my perspective i ve played a many of those a i have the other sort it s just some get more publicity or make more money at the box office or something i m perfectly happy to be colonel brandon in sense sensibility a i am any of those powerful character it s just part of an actor s job and you just alter the color that you get out of the cupboard how wa it to reunite had you seen each other since doing press for the eighth harry potter movie rickman no because i think we d both been so busy doing other thing but it wa great to see him on the set and it wa great to watch all three of them i saw emma watson the other night in london in a restaurant and i saw daniel radcliffe recently in london because he wa doing a play it s great to watch the three of them moving forward into the rest of their life and being working actor and not trapped by one image grint not really no actually i love alan he s always been one of my favorite but yeah it wa quite weird seeing him in a whole new kind of environment because i m trying to think back i don t think i ever really saw him outside of that wig and cloak which potter co star would you most like to reunite with grint there are so many all of them i ve already loved working with them i like michael gambon he s so cool just a remarkable guy i ve worked with julie walter before a well i love her she s great now for something more fun it s october what s your favorite halloween costume you ve ever worn rickman laugh the thing about halloween is to me it just mean because it s so different in england we used to have something called bonfire night and we d have firework that s disappeared and i know halloween s taken over halloween to me a a child wa the family would fill a bowl of water and you d have apple bobbing in it and you d get apple out of a bowl of water to me it just mean a soaking wet shirt grint i liked halloween it never used to be a big thing when i wa kid we never really did it but i actually had a good costume not that long ago the last one i dressed a a play doh can that i made you know play doh of course grint well literally i actually made it it wa a yellow bin i cut the bottom out and i just wore a yellow bin with a play doh logo with a yellow hat it s not very practical do you have a favorite halloween candy rickman i don t even know what that mean the word chocolate would loom large grint a favorite halloween candy i don t really know i never trick or treated when i wa younger because we lived on a block of house that were

what if there were a miracle elixir that could chase that hangover cloud away and better still what if that magic drink were something you could easily pick up at your local supermarket a group of chinese researcher say that they may have indeed found this perfect hangover cure and it go by the name of sprite after examining 57 beverage in a lab researcher hua bin li and his colleague at sun yat sen university in guangzhou determined that sprite wa one of the drink that best relieved hangover symptom the team of scientist had hypothesized that what you consume after drinking booze could alter the effect of alcohol on your body specifically they theorized that certain drink could impact the body s metabolism of alcohol in a way that would help alleviate hangover symptom chemistry world explains it this way some of the adverse effect of alcohol are thought to be caused not by the ethanol itself but by ethanol s first metabolite acetaldehyde ethanol is metabolized into acetaldehyde by the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase adh and then into acetate by aldehyde dehydrogenase aldh unlike acetaldehyde acetate is innocuous and may even be responsible for some of the positive health benefit of alcohol consumption therefore the key to reducing alcohol related damage lie in minimizing the amount of time acetaldehyde is present in the body the chinese researcher therefore decided that they would look at how the different beverage impacted the activity of adh and aldh some beverage were found to be terrible for a hangover an herbal infusion with hemp seed for example wa discovered to boost the activity of adh while inhibiting aldh therefore slowing down the breakdown of acetaldehyde and dragging out the hangover effect on the other hand some drink including sprite known in china a xue bi and a type of soda water were found to have the opposite effect increasing the activity of aldh and thus speeding up the breakdown of acetaldehyde the researcher are reportedly planning to conduct the test in living organism but the result have already generated a lot of buzz a people around the world celebrate the possible death of the hangover however expert warn that we

outwardly express it however what if there wa something about professor mcgonagall that we never thought about before reddit user obversa made a stunning revelation about one of the most bad as witch in the entire hp saga obversa suggests that professor mcgonagall wa originally hired by dumbledore to teach defense against the dark art dada in 1956 however not long after tom riddle lord voldemort came back to hogwarts seeking the dada position for himself dumbledore denied voldemort s application and a a result voldemort cast a jinx to prevent any dada professor from lasting more than a year dumbledore then transferred mcgonagall to the transfiguration position before the term s end to prevent anything bad or dangerous from happening to her after all a long a she wasn t teaching dada the jinx technically wouldn t apply to her obversa say prior to being headmaster dumbledore served a transfiguration professor for several decade teaching tom riddle himself a a child he wa also mcgonagall s predecessor under headmaster armando dippet thus when dumbledore succeeded dippet he would have left a vacancy for the spot of transfiguration we know that minerva mcgonagall filled this vacancy but what led her there a a result of pottermore we know a bit more about professor mcgonagall s backstory which is extremely similar to lord voldermort s background mcgonagall wa appointed a dumbledore s assistant in 1956 not a his replacement but why would dumbledore hire a brilliant mcgonagall just a his assistant and not to a full teaching position when she first arrived back at hogwarts if you recall one of the reason why headmaster dippet rejected tom riddle s application for the dada teaching position at age 17 18 for tom wa because tom wa too young however dippet encouraged tom to come back a few to several year later to apply again at the time mcgonagall wa still perhaps too young to be a hogwarts professor in her own right additionally in harry potter and the order of the phoenix mcgonagall told dolores umbridge that she had been teaching at hogwarts for thirty nine year this december order of the phoenix take place in 1995 and 1996 with this statement coming in approximately september 1995 therefore mcgonagall s official hiring would have been in the middle of the school year very odd timing but why would mcgonagall who is obviously gifted in transfiguration initially apply to be the defense against the dark art instructor take note of professor mcgonagall s wand it s made of fir with a core of dragon heartstring the wandmaker ollivander once called it the the survivor s wand because he had sold it to three wizard who subsequently passed through mortal peril unscathed this mean that if the wand chooses the wizard mcgonagall would have been destined for a lot more than transfiguration it seems likely then that mcgonagall started teaching a dumbledore s assistant in december of 1956 and at some point applied for and received the dada job however lord voldemort arrived to hogwarts shortly thereafter wanting to snag the position for himself once dumbledore refused voldy put a hex on the position so mcgonagall had to be transferred to transfiguration after all the dark lord wa probably angry vindictive and jealous of mcgonagall and wanted to take his revenge for what he saw a what wa rightfully his he wa also obsessed with the

intercept mosquito in flight naled doe not pose a health risk to either people or pet when sprayed in low concentration according to both the environmental protection agency pdf and the center for disease control and prevention however in it own review of naled the european union came to a different conclusion naled degrades to dichlorvos a toxic chemical in the presence of sunlight and according to the eu scientific commission this can cause genetic mutation a a result the eu ha banned agricultural use of product containing naled in puerto rico where a public health emergency ha been declared due to the sheer number of case of zika recommendation from the cdc and the epa to use aerial spraying to control the mosquito population there have been stymied by protest activist

department of health to reduce the population of adult mosquito some of which may be capable of spreading virus including zika originally scheduled for wednesday the aerial spraying operation wa delayed because of poor weather condition when naled get sprayed it knock out the mosquito but if sprayed over water it break down quickly said bryn phillips a specialist in the university of california davis environmental toxicology department his research indicates that the insecticide break down into different chemical version of naled one of these version dichlorvos is quite toxic to aquatic specie at the low end of the food chain like aquatic insect and frog larva basically fish food phillips said if the chemical are rotated and managed properly an environmental area can recover phillips noted naled spray droplet stay airborne for an extended period and the chemical begin to break down once exposed to sunlight or water very little of the low concentration spray settle on the

anyone ha ever truly observed or more importantly measured a bird fart but between ornithologist veterinarian and amateur bird watcher how is it possible no one ha ever seen the feathered creature flatulate a monterey bay aquarium veterinarian mike murray said in a 2009 article for popular science bird are capable of passing gas but they don t because they lack the same combination of diet and gas forming bacteria in their gut that give mammal their odorous gas murray added that if he spotted gas in an x ray of a bird s gastrointestinal tract he d be concerned something wa wrong with the bird but laura eriksen a birder educator and blogger at the cornell lab of ornithology ha a different theory in a blog post on her website she posit that bird have much shorter digestive tract than mammal so there s le time for gas to build up allowing fart to slip by undetected in another blog post she describes the only written account she s aware of describing a possible bird fart it come from former cornell student alan richard weisbrod in his 1965 master s thesis on blue jay one of the bird in front of me defecated a small puff of whitish gas wa expelled along with the feces the feces dropped from the bird while the gas wafted below and parallel to the slightly raised tail until it dissipated rapidly into the cold air the gas could be clearly seen against the dark colored eave that hang over the sheltered perch upon which the bird were fluffed and resting several day later a bird perched in the same position wa observed to defecate with the accompanying wisp of whitish gas weisbrod go on to describe how bird eat similar diet to many mammal who definitely flatulate but explains that he could not find any other account of bird flatulence at that time and apparently no scientist ha stepped up to the plate to follow up on weisbrod s observation he also acknowledges that the wisp of whitish gas could also have simply been water vapor steam rising from the feces just think of how your dog s poop steam in the cold when you take him out for his daily business in the winter it s a little difficult to know for sure that bird rarely or never fart according to mental_floss human fart are smelly due to a combination of our diet and the microbe in our gut that help digest the food in our diet a video by asapscience add that the longer the food stay in the gut the more time it ha to ferment and break down into it smellier component namely sulfur so if bird don t have the right food microbe combo and intestinal length to produce smelly gas then we wouldn t smell it without a smell bird fart rustle no one s feather but even if bird produced immaculate odorless gas would we hear it that is le clear according to a q a with proctologist lester gottesman in vice fart make a sound due to the composition of gas and the shape read tightness of the sphincter a lot of the gas that make up a fart gottesman said is swallowed air and a lot of swallowed air lead to a lot of gas which can make a bigger beefier noise but how much air doe a swallow swallow when a swallow swallow air a far a we could tell this isn t a question any scientist ha specifically tried to measure but the daily dot reached out to the cornell lab of ornithology for answer nonetheless according to an ornithologist there relayed via email by the lab s good humored press officer miyoko chu bird definitely swallow air but he think they expel it via burping rather than farting he added that he think bird do fart in some case and would depend on what specie their diet and whether it is observable he also said that he s never personally noticed a bird fart lastly maybe they do swallow enough air that would leave most animal saying excuse me after a butt bellow but perhaps something

than someone who start later past study have shown that giving worker a little leeway in setting their hour make them happier and more productive presumably a win for both the employee and the company that s why company like google and microsoft let employee work from home or adjust their schedule to account for personal responsibility like taking a child to school in the morning but the study suggests a downside your bos may be unconsciously judging you for giving yourself a later start time regardless of how much work you re getting done in the study which will be published in full in the journal of applied psychology later this year researcher asked 149 supervisor to rate an employee s performance employee start time ranged from 5 a m to 9 45 a m even when employee who started later in the day worked the same number of hour a those who started earlier supervisor were inclined to rate employee who began work earlier a more conscientious and gave them higher performance rating boss who preferred to work later hour themselves were le inclined to display this morning bias in a second experiment the researcher assigned a group of 141 college student the role of a supervisor and asked each student to review a profile of a fictitious employee the performance of the fictional employee wa the same in all case but start time varied across profile researcher found that employee who worked from 7 a m to 3 p m were consistently given higher rating of conscientiousness and performance by the student supervisor than employee who worked from 11 a m to 7 p m the researcher concluded that employee who can opt for flexible work schedule should shift their schedule earlier not later to account for manager morning bias it seems likely that some employee are experiencing a decrement in their performance rating that is not based on anything having to do with their actual performance the three researcher wrote in a post for the harvard business review this morning bias appears to be deeply ingrained in a word association experiment designed to test the implicit stereotype that early riser are more diligent worker the researcher also found that a majority of the 120 working adult surveyed linked word associated with the morning like sunrise with word associated with conscientiousness like industriousness another recent study covered by the new york time further suggests there may be an implicit view among some manager that employee who take advantage of flexible work policy in any way are le conscientious than employee who work more traditional hour most organization still treat workplace flexibility a an accommodation erin kelly a sociology professor at the university of minnesota told the time you are implicitly saying most of u will be working these traditional way and the reward will come to those working these traditional way and that is where you have this stigma or career penalty although the study did not consider gender it seems woman could be more adversely affected by morning bias than men that s because more woman than men are primary caregiver for their child and assume a disproportionate amount of household task according to a

to wave to nostalgic lakers fan on the big screen i think the lakers are trying to move away from that kind of stuff jackson said a we spoke briefly outside the knicks locker room on dec 11 there wa such a distance in the way he said the lakers this after all is the man who won five nba title in los angeles and wa still engaged to lakers president jeanie bus but that distance wa real and it had kept growing a the year went by and jackson spent more and more time in new york running the knicks and in montana with his child and grandchild during the offseason his connection with los angeles and his fiance e wa simply too hard to maintain on tuesday night bus and jackson announced that they were mutually ending their four year engagement the announcement via their personal twitter account brought an end to the nba s version of camelot like the camelot in richard burton s broadway musical this had always been an impossible romance the owner s daughter dating the team s coach and not just any owner only one of the most powerful owner of all time lakers owner dr jerry bus and not just any coach only the most successful nba coach of all time then there were hurdle such a jeanie bus being the team s vice president in charge of business affair at the time and her brother jim bus being in charge of basketball operation so many tangled web and yet jeanie bus and jackson somehow made it work for 17 year during the best of time when the lakers were winning nba championship they d ride to the arena together from their house in marina del rey at game jeanie would sit with her girlfriend linda rambis and stacy kennedy in the second row across the court from the lakers bench where phil could see her and the player could hear her once on the drive in jackson mentioned lamar odom needed a little extra encouragement a he adjusted to his new role a a sixth man so during the game bus and her girlfriend made a point of cheering for odom a he checked into the game take your pant off they yelled out a odom shed his warm ups near the scorer table he beamed at the attention it wa a small thing but it wa those kind of gesture that made the impossible relationship work for so many year the way they d work in tandem and share thought about the team with each other that wa camelot once jackson retired a coach in 2011 thing started changing at first he wa home all the time plotting his next move he had no intention of coaching again his body couldn t take it and his spirit wa leading him in other direction toward a front office career which would allow him to test his principle from on high way above the court but when dr bus wa diagnosed with terminal cancer in 2012 and the franchise needed a coach of some stature to come in and lead the team of superstar kobe bryant pau gasol dwight howard and steve nash for what appeared to be dr bus last ride jackson raised his hand a always he would do it for jeanie this time the lakers didn t call on him or rather general manager mitch kupchak called him around midnight to tell him the lakers had chosen to hire mike d antoni instead jackson wa livid his agent issued a blistering statement decrying the disrespect shown to the coach who had won five title for l a and wa willing to come out of retirement to coach the team and help his fiancee s family at a critical juncture it did not break apart their relationship though if anything it strengthened it about six week later jackson proposed to jeanie bus his knee and hip were too stiff to get down on one knee not that he is the grand gesture type anyway what wa important is that he knew getting engaged would make her happy and give her father some peace a he lay dying the engagement wa almost destined to stay at that level once jackson became president of the knicks in 2014 jackson and bus had to sign document that ensured there would be no conflict of interest between the two franchise according to source that included a provision that the nba and it owner be informed if they ever decided to marry so now not only were they living apart they couldn t talk about their job when they were together if they ever did decide to marry it would further complicate their business relationship a the year went by jackson focused in on the knicks and bus focused on the lakers he would come to los angeles when he could and she would see him in new york when she attended board of governor meeting but friend say it got harder and harder to find time to connect both of their legacy are tied to what they do next bus must decide whether to reboot the lakers front office jackson need to make the knicks into a contender those close to jackson say he intends to stay for the full five year of his contract with the knicks despite the mutual option that s built into his contract this summer there had been speculation that jackson could return to the lakers this offseason when they might need a new guide in the front office and he could amicably part from new york those are the type of implausible thing that happen in camelot it wa never meant to be bus ha been spending the past year supervising the development of the team s new practice facility and working tirelessly on the league s new collective bargaining agreement she also ha maintained close tie with first year coach luke walton which is a departure from her distant relationship with previous lakers coach those close to bus say she also ha been giving more thought to the looming question of the team s front office all of those are massive thing that

this is when my history teacher the varsity coach pulled me aside and suggested i shouldn t bother i d probably be cut he said adding that i wa getting very good grade for me practice did not make perfect lo and behold i now have scientific validation a meta analysis in perspective in psychological science looked at 33 study on the relationship between deliberate practice and athletic achievement and found that practice just doesn t matter that much more precisely the analysis found practice can account for 18 percent of the difference in athletic success put another way if we compare batting average between two baseball player the amount of time the player spent in the batting cage would only account for 18 percent of the reason one player s average is better than the other even more simply some people are just better at sport than others and the difference cannot be made up by practice alone there wa a reason i lagged behind my peer on the lacrosse field they probably had a natural advantage on me one important thing that s easy to misunderstand is that this is looking at variance across people not within an individual brooke macnamara the lead author of the perspective paper tell me so if a person practice they will get better almost across the board practice should improve one s performance but it also mean that for the same amount of practice some will end up being better at sport than others essentially learning rate vary macnamara say some people improve very quickly with le practice while others require much more practice the analysis found this 18 percent figure is roughly true no matter what type of sport is being played practice account for the same difference in performance in bowling a it doe field hockey two completely different activity practice also explains fewer difference in ability the further an athlete ascends into higher level of play which suggests deliberate practice loses it predictive power beyond a certain level of skill the study report the analysis also found that the age when athlete started their sport didn t change this figure much either so what then explains the remaining 82 percent here s where we should note a limitation of studying practice researcher typically ask athlete to recall their schedule and practice hour and memory can be faulty but macnamara doesn t think better measurement of practice would make that 18 percent figure leap up to near 100 there s probably not one huge contributor that s accounting for everything else she say instead there s likely a whole constellation of factor some of which are genetic or biological in nature that explain why some people are better athlete than others they include personality and perseverance propensity to get injured propensity to choke under pressure individual difference in maximum oxygen uptake difference in how we acquire muscle mass coordination height enjoyment of competition we have so many factor within a person that can contribute to athletic performance different gene different cognitive ability different physical attribute she say all of those thing are important and interact with each other which is why it is so hard to pin down what predicts performance overall she say the finding is a strike against the popular 10 000 hour rule which implies anyone can become master at an activity if they were to just devote the time to it the research in sport and in other activity such a music game and education just doesn t back that hypothesis up on the other hand it s not like these finding are an excuse not to try eighteen percent is big macnamara say we re trying to argue against these idea that it s so important it account for nearly everything practice matter but it s unlikely to bridge the gap between inborn superstar and your average or perhaps clumsy kid for the athletically un inclined like myself it s a bit of a relief it s okay if you can t make up the difference with practice or if you re just a slow learner when it come to sport it s also okay to just enjoy being on a team trying hard but knowing you ll unlikely be the best growing up my dad wa on a quest to find my sport the

then slump in our couch and then slump into bed how big is justin bieber s penis really the swaggy lil pop star and his cavalry of minder would have u believe that justin bieber ha a huge dick last week calvin klein released photo of bieber modeling their underwear for a new ad campaign one memorable shot showed off the singer s protruding package in arresting profile shortly after the photo hit the internet a web site called breathe heavy posted what it claimed wa the same image prior to re touching if that claim were accurate it would mean that calvin klein well not him personally although maybe had stuffed bieber s stocking nearly to bursting here are the two image side by side bieber s team immediately insisted that breathe heavy s photo wa fake and requested the web site take it down breathe heavy complied originally replacing the photo with an editor s note but eventually removing the entire post altogether in that since deleted note breathe heavy s editor seems to accept bieber s explanation at gunpoint bieber denies the photo is real and i respect that and will believe him the question therefore is are the claim of the bieber camp correct and the photo fake or did breathe heavy have the real photo and capitulate in the face of legal intimidation it s easy to make a case that breathe heavy s photo are the real deal we know that at least one photo wa significantly retouched prior to publication a bieber s camp did not dispute an earlier tmz story alleging that calvin klein sculpted bieber s pecs filled out his ab and bestowed him pubes in this ad from the campaign furthermore virtually every celebrity photoshoot in america get touched up at some point why would bieber s dick be a grand outlier but in many way this dispute is just a lead in to an essential american question what exactly is bieber packing let s be true detective this is a screencap taken from a video of the calvin klein shoot that bieber himself posted to instagram here we have a direct unaltered view of his package and can plainly see that it look quite different than the massive knot he is sporting in the photo advertisement front bulge will almost always look le impressive than side bluge granted and this is a fine bulge certainly but one that seems far off of calvin klein s idealized burmese python last september bieber appeared onstage at the fashion rock concert for some reason he stripped down to his underwear which produced a number of generally alarming photo such a this one there are a number of thing we can glean from this photo one is that justin bieber ha muscle look at the strong boy another is that his happy trail doe indeed appear to stop abruptly right about where it doe in the pre photoshop version of the calvin klein shot in which a model grope him but because bieber wore jet black brief that reveal no hint of bulge this photo doesn t help u understand how big his dick actually is for that we must consult more candid shot in 2013 bieber went to hawaii and jumped off a cliff after exiting the water he wa photographed walking on the beach resulting in the image you see here this is perhaps the most revealing shot of bieber s bulge in the wild doe it look exceedingly large i d say not in fact it look like any man s normal penis of course it should be noted that it s unfair to judge a dick by what it look like immediately after being submerged in the sea however we can only work with the material we have next we will consult a tumblr called justin bieber s bulge a blog dedicated to justin bieber s glorious wonderful bulge which is not run by me for a tumblr devoted to one man s dick it s a pretty boring blog but there is one compelling photo here is a fan shot of justin bieber in concert his leather drop crotch pant dropped well below his crotch we can see a hint of bulge and from this angle it doe not look like justin bieber is trying to smuggle a butternut squash through airport security a calvin klein might want u to believe that is evidence supporting the theory that justin bieber is adequately endowed arguing in favor of justin bieber s alleged big dick are two people tati neve a brazilian model and bieber s trainer patrick nilsson these two claim to have seen bieber s flesh in the flesh and if we re to believe them calvin klein ha staked it reputation on the right massive dong neve claim to have slept with bieber during his infamous brazilian sex romp here is what she told a british tabloid about bieber s d speaking to the sun brazilian model tati neva said take it from me he s well endowed and very good in bed nilsson meanwhile wa shuttled out to do damage control in the wake of the calvin klein photoshop controversy here according to breathe heavy is his assessment and to make up it here s a new quote from justin s trainer patrick nilsson who say jb is packing i can definitely confirm that he is a well endowed guy i sound weird saying that but yes indeed you do two people claim to have personal connection with justin bieber s dick and claim it is large but one is on justin bieber s payroll while we will consider their opinion the overwhelming visual evidence suggests that justin bieber s penis is perfectly average large enough to adequately fill out a pair of brief but not so large that it could arouse envy and terror when plastered across

tv station there there wa literally like three people there it wa so bizarre so bizarre whoa dallas took a chance on me at frickin no 9 it wa incredible dirk nowitzki on his reaction to being drafted by the mavs in 1998 then ross flew out again and donnie and nellie stayed for a few day and talked to me over and over they said hey don t make a decision before we fly you to dallas we want you to see everything and meet some of the guy so i agreed to that i flew back with donnie and holger stayed at nellie s house back in the day had a press conference never had a suit so i remember right from the airport we went right to lombardo s custom apparel in dallas i had the worst jacket on and we had a press conference that s when i met nashie steve nash for the first time because they flew him in for the press conference it kind of clicked from there i think on my second night nellie threw a little barbecue at his house for me and fin michael finley came and strick erick strickland came nashie wa there and some of the other guy who were in town i just got to mingle a little bit and meet them and speak a much a i could with my english then the next night wa our decision they set a press conference the morning before i left and nellie wa like think about it all night but we need a decision before you leave so that night wa rough i remember i wa sitting with holger around the pool for hour obviously i had concern i had concern about making that huge jump i d never lived anywhere but with my parent i guess the end of the story wa we ll try they had a young team it wasn t like they were a great team right then not really a playoff team so you could get some minute and develop nellie said at the end of the day if thing don t work out you could always go back to europe that s always an option after two or three year when your contract is over if they don t take the option after three year you re back home in europe so the next day i went to the press conference and wa like i ll try pierce i remember slipping and not really knowing where i wa going to end up because i only worked out for the top five team i remember i didn t know who jason williams wa and he got drafted ahead of me it wa just weird i thought i d be in the top five and i slipped all the way to 10 so it wa a strange night for me and then i go to boston a team i really didn t like growing up because i wa a lakers fan but you know thing happen for a reason i guess it wa meant for me to be in boston it worked out ok carter you finally get to the draft after working out for five or six team and it s the unexpected we knew either bibby or olowokandi wa going one or two and then after that it s all hearsay i heard anywhere from three to eight that s what i hear so you kind of have to hang your hat on that unless you get that phone call ok we re going to get you if you re available i just remember sitting around olowokandi ok bibby ok raef lafrentz great from there you really didn t know i remember sitting at the table next to me wa antawn jamison our family were sitting next to each other laughing and talking i remember saying man what do you think is going to happen we had no idea they called antawn at four i mean he wa my suitemate in college and very good friend so i wa over the moon it felt like i got drafted because i wa just nervous and excited for him a if it wa me but the weird thing about it at the time wa that he never worked out for toronto so it wa kind of like ok well they just really wanted him i worked out for them and toronto told me basically if you re available we re going to go get you so you might a well come work out that s what we were hearing so i took my workout and everything i wa introduced to the business of basketball pretty much in the first five minute i wa on the west coast back to the east coast in a matter of five minute vince carter on being traded from golden state to toronto on draft night but then they drafted him so i wa just perplexed a little bit like wait a minute what the heck s going on here but nevertheless i wa excited for him and like whatever you know you re just living in the moment then i started looking around when the camera start getting close to you you figure they re talking about you this could be it you try to play it cool then i get the phone call like right before and they call your name and it wa just over the moon i remember getting my hat from hat lady chrysa chin and then i m walking up the step and a i m walking i see antawn at the bottom of the step still i wa like hey what s up a soon a i took the picture david stern say to me wait right here there s about to be a trade we ll go from there ok i step back i m holding my hat looking at it the first thing i said is dang somebody s getting traded already on draft night dang it it wa me and it all came together well antawn i guess got the word that there wa going to be a trade that s why he wa sitting there i didn t know because of course by the time it wa happening i wa already walking up to the stage it blindsides me pretty much but then it all made sense i wa introduced to the business of basketball pretty much in the first five minute i wa on the west coast back to the east coast in a matter of five minute mind you everybody at their table had their hat fixed perfectly basically here s your hat to that table here s your hat to this table it wa a pretty cool thing not only did jamison and i get to experience the draft beside each other but we got traded for each other a well so it wa pretty cool nowitzki vince just had unbelievable athleticism i mean he did stuff that i don t think we ve seen before in this league i wa in oakland at his dunk contest in 2000 and nobody s ever seen the stuff that he did but what kept him so long in the league now wa really his skill level even though obviously he still ha some athleticism still ha some hop but it s his shot the repertoire of fadeaways that he s got his 3 ball wa always money and he s a big guy for a 2 or 3 that wa always good on the block he d run a pick and roll going to his right where he wa always deadly i mean he wa a tough matchup because he could post and he wa so freakishly athletic he d come off a down pick and just jump up and really nobody could get to his shot obviously he s so athletic that once he got going to the rim you could challenge him but he wa going to put you on a poster he wa fun to watch during his prime pierce he had unique ability something you hardly see great athleticism and great shooting touch usually you see one without the other he had the combination of both that s rare it s something this league ha not seen in a long time pierce dirk changed the game man when you look at what he wa able to bring with his versatility and his shooting a a 7 footer to be able to put the ball on the ground he wa one of the first stretch 4 that you see more of today i mean he revolutionized the game player like that are transcendent he wa a transcendent player carter first of all his work ethic he put a lot of time in and it s different than any other player i ve ever seen i ve been around long enough to see a lot of guy train and prepare but he just love the game he love to play he love to compete and he s selfless he s all about the good of the team that s one thing having the opportunity to play with a go to guy a superstar like himself is that he s willing to make the right play it s not always like the play is for me i have to make the shot the play is for me i have to make the right play that s his mentality but when he want the ball he s going to say give me the ball he s a professional scorer i say this about myself too and you could probably say it about paul a well when you see him walk into the arena before a game you could probably say there s no way in hell that those guy are playing tonight then dirk will come in and drop 35 regardless of how he feel before the game once the big light are on and you come on the court he know how to get it done plain and simple nowitzki he wa strong he d get to his spot he wa a clutch shooter he definitely had the clutch gene great pump fake could get to the foul line i mean he wa the complete package from the small forward standpoint you put a smaller guy on him he wa able to post and shoot over him could drive both way even ran some pick and roll and when it mattered he made big shot i wouldn t say he wa a great flat out 3 point shooter but when the game wa on the line you never really wanted him shooting the 3 he wa a competitor and really just a great all around player carter he wa a killer he s been like that since high school i remember u playing against each other in the mcdonald s all american game and just being around each other he s always had the mentality to score and wanted to dominate while having the ability to do whatever he wanted he had the big body and he knew how to use it there are some people who are big and strong but they don t use it like that paul used it and he wa deceptively quick so when he got the ball in the logo area and he would swing through and put his body on you you just hope he missed i ve had many many many great battle against him and know him very well of course we all know paul can shoot the heck out of the basketball from the 3 point line he s just another professional scorer nowitzki i wa always the young guy the german wunderkind the young guy coming up with talent it felt like the next thing you know i wa 30 those year just flew by you re having fun you re competing every year and then in the summer it s not like i wa just sitting on my butt in my 20 i played national team every year so literally i took like two week off and then wa right back in the gym working with holger if you stay busy time fly so my 20 i felt like they were over in a heartbeat next thing you know you re 30 and you re sort of like a mid aged guy couple of young guy but still a couple older guy then the last few year you re just the oldest guy it s amazing how 19 year just have flown by but if you stay busy if you have a blast now i m still trying to compete i enjoy doing it obviously it s not a easy a back in the day all the extra work you have to put in to stay ready now dealing with injury that i really never had it take the fun away a little bit but hopefully i can stay healthy and have fun pierce oh it s fun i m enjoying every moment shootaround i m enjoying the bus ride the plane ride with the guy i m enjoying every last bit of camaraderie that i m going to get with my team in the locker room on the court i m just soaking it all in i ve been around this game for a long time a lot of plane ride a lot of bus ride a lot of pregame speech a lot of national anthem i m enjoying the ride man i know this is the last year so i m enjoying it a much a i can carter i m a little uneasy sometimes some day i m ok with it i know it s near and i m preparing myself for it but some day i m like man i m not ready to walk away from it because i still enjoy being in the gym i still enjoy running around and competing and laughing and joking there s nothing better when you ve done this so long it s all you know maybe not all i know but all i ve done and all i ve enjoyed doing at this point now i m prepared to move on to phase 2 but it s kind of like you do all the preparation to be prepared but you re not prepared if that make sense i remember seeing all of the other guy with the raptor seeing oak charles oakley and antonio davis and kevin willis and hakeem olajuwon watching them in their final year then they stepped out in the world and were just kind of like where do i go from here i mean those guy were prepared it s something i never really thought about until i m going to say five year ago just making sure i m ready because you hear the story about guy who step out into the world when they retire and it s like all right i have some money in my pocket where do i go then just spending and spending and you hear the next horror story that they go broke that s something that i vow never to do for me an idle mind is just awful i think i d be a miserable person and i d get on a lot of people s nerve if i m retired and i have nothing to do i can t just sit around people are like oh you get to retire and go to all these country and visit i can t do that that s not who i am i m not a vacation guy like that i wouldn t like it i know that so i d have to find something to do that s where phase 2 started year ago a far a kind of introducing myself to different people and figuring out what i m really passionate about the coaching thing is still up in the air i get asked about it all the time i enjoy it but i don t know if i want to do it it s just the weirdest thing i guess it make sense but to me it still doesn t make sense how is it that you enjoy it have been doing it all these year but can see yourself coaching full time i really can t see myself a a coach a of right now in the broadcasting world i can see it clear a day i m still fighting with that other than that i m ready to go when the time is right there s some morning i wake up and it s like is it one more year or is it this year or is it three year i can never decide on a number scary it really is for me because i love this game and i don t want to leave it not yet nowitzki heavy sigh that sound like a lot but you know hopefully i can stay out there and i can score a few vince ha been on a tear for a while and paul i don t think is playing much but you know we re going to try all three of u are competitor i think a you get older it s more important to be on a winning team i m sure vince is enjoying that the grizzly are playing well and paul is enjoying the clipper we need some work pierce it s going to be tough it s not looking good i m not playing much our only chance is vince carter now dirk ha been hurt but who know man we ve got a shot we ve got a shot but i think lebron james dwyane wade and carmelo anthony are going to crush it lebron wade and melo are coming and they re coming fast carter it s possible it s possible i mean god willing with health of course and opportunity i think it s possible if we stay healthy dirk want to play another year and with his ability to score he s going to get touch i m putting all of the pressure on him",

cambridge who wa not involved in the new study in the traditional view of cancer mutation strike a cell these mutation have several cause including toxin and virus however they arise they drive a cell to multiply uncontrollably until the cancer is wiped out by the immune system or kill it victim either way the cancer stay inside the body where it started a decade ago scientist discovered two exception in the 1990s tasmanian devil in australia began developing deadly face tumor but dna in the tumor cell did not match that of the affected animal study showed tasmanian facial tumor disease a it wa eventually called appears to have had it start in a single tasmanian devil that lived in the 1980s transmitted by bite the cancer spread to other tasmanian devil and acquired mutation along the way that helped make it even more infectious a second strain of the cancer wa identified last year dog too can get a type of contagious cancer called canine transmissible venereal tumor which jump from host to host during sex the tumor usually disappears in a few month however scientist have determined that the cancer originated in dog 11 000 year ago for year tasmanian devil and dog were the only specie known to contract contagious cancer but last year stephen p goff a molecular biologist at columbia university and his colleague found contagious cancer in soft shell clam from new york to prince edward island these clam have suffered from aggressive tumor since the 1970s carol reinisch a marine biologist at environment canada found that the cancer clustered in population a if it wa caused by an outbreak of some sort she suspected a cancer causing virus moving from host to host for help dr reinisch turned to dr goff the two researcher found no evidence of a virus in the soft shell clam but they did discover that dna in the tumor cell carried a genetic sequence not found in healthy cell in the clam after examining the dna they confirmed that the cancer cell in different clam all came from a single common ancestor somehow this cancer ha been spreading from clam to clam up the coast dr goff said he and his colleague began to wonder if other specie of clam or related animal known collectively a bivalve had contagious cancer of their own and if so why they chose to study cancer in mussel cockle and golden carpet shell clam in every case the researcher reported in the journal nature the cancer in the animal were contagious we are now at four for four dr goff said a it turned out the cancer in cockle comprises two separate strain even stranger the cancer cell in the golden carpet shell clam did not develop from the specie s own cell instead the scientist matched the cancer s dna to pullet shell clam which live in the same intertidal bed off the coast of spain but dr goff and his colleague could not locate any pullet shell clam with this disease they concluded that this strain of contagious cancer must have started in pullet shell clam and then jumped specie infecting golden carpet shell clam it killed all the vulnerable pullet shell clam leaving only resistant one behind that s really quite incredible dr murchison said noting that scientist had tried without success to infect fox and other dog relative with canine cancer the new study she said show that contagious cancer can indeed cross the specie barrier with eight contagious cancer now on the book dr murchison ha started to wonder if they are not a peculiar a previously thought they might be emerging fairly often she said so should people worry about an outbreak of infectious cancer i don t think we should be starting to panic dr murchison said there have been rare report of people transmitting cancer an estimated 0 04 percent of organ transplant recipient contract cancer from the donor organ for example but in these case the cancer doe not spread like a true parasite from host to host yet it s not inconceivable that a human cancer might gain that power in 1965 scientist put mosquito in a cage with hamster one of which had cancer the mosquito carried the cancer cell to the healthy hamster the new research doe raise the possibility that these type of disease could arise in

protected from word and idea that make them uncomfortable everett piper president of oklahoma wesleyan university weighed in with a letter to the campus community this past week i actually had a student come forward after a university chapel service and complain because he felt victimized by a sermon on the topic of 1 corinthian 13 it appears that this young scholar felt offended because a homily on love made him feel bad for not showing love in his mind the speaker wa wrong for making him and his peer feel uncomfortable i m not making this up our culture ha actually taught our kid to be this self absorbed and narcissistic any time their feeling are hurt they are the victim anyone who dare challenge them and thus make them feel bad about themselves is a hater a bigot an oppressor and a victimizer i have a message for this young man and all others who care to listen that feeling of discomfort you have after listening to a sermon is called a conscience an altar call is supposed to make you feel bad it is supposed to make you feel guilty the goal of many a good sermon is to get you to confess your sin not coddle you in your selfishness the primary objective of the church and the christian faith is your confession not your self actualization so here s my advice if you want the chaplain to tell you you re a victim rather than tell you that you need virtue this may not be the university you re looking for if you want to complain about a sermon that make you feel le than loving for not showing love this might be the wrong place if you re more interested in playing the hater card than you are in confessing your own hate if you want to arrogantly lecture rather than humbly learn if you don t want to feel guilt in your soul when you are guilty of sin if you want to be enabled rather than confronted there are many university across the land in missouri and elsewhere that will give you exactly what you want but oklahoma wesleyan isn t one of them at okwu we teach you to be selfless rather than self centered we are more interested in you practicing personal forgiveness than political revenge we want you to model interpersonal reconciliation rather than foment personal conflict we believe the content of your character is more important than the color of your skin we don t believe that you have been victimized every time you feel guilty and we don t issue trigger warning before altar call oklahoma wesleyan is not a safe place but rather a place to learn to learn that life isn t about you but about others that the bad feeling you have while listening to

which educates player on how to make their money last long after they stop playing personal finance acumen is important for everyone it doesn t matter if you re a high income or a low income earner or somewhere in between if you re old or young or single or married it s important for everyone you would think one of the professor leading the class at the camp said this but tim did after being asked why he attended spouse of player were invited to the event which wa held between april 4 and april 7 in fort lauderdale fla meet the nfl player who lived in a utility closet in college to save money 1 31 tim masthay of the green bay packer and his wife amanda are the best team in the nfl when it come to personal finance when we asked the masthays what they did with his first big nfl paycheck they said a big chunk went toward the league s 401 k plan and another went into an education fund for their young child and when asked if he ever had to switch financial adviser like many athlete do because they re not happy with the advice or return they re getting tim said he s never had one he invests his money himself in low cost index fund and if you re wondering how many credit card they have they have one also see what it s like to take a finance class with a lot of nfl player tim 29 met his wife amanda while they were sophomore at the university of kentucky they married soon after graduating and have two child and a third on the way they re clearly a great team but what made them so smart about money here s what they shared with u what it s like to make so much money while you re in your 20 tim wasn t drafted out of college but wa signed and released by the indianapolis colt before the 2009 season started he later signed with the green bay packer and ha had great success with them he signed a five year 6 million contract in 2012 that included a 1 2 million signing bonus and he won a super bowl with the packer in 2011 i almost fell on the floor when i saw his first paycheck amanda masthay while tim wa trying to make an nfl roster amanda wa working a a bank teller making 9 an hour that wa all the money we had so we went from getting by to the first paycheck that he got i almost fell on the floor when i saw it i had never seen that much money in my life amanda said they were tempted to buy thing when they got the check it took a lot of restraint and we sort of had to wrap our head around it so that we didn t buy some car that we really couldn t afford she said tim say that first paycheck wa for 9 000 and that while it wa a lot of money to him too it wa at the league minimum there wa this influx of money at a young age where we were accustomed to being on scholarship but it wasn t quite a traumatic a what some player who are top draft pick experience the unique financial challenge of being an nfl player and the wife of a player when you start making a lot of money in the league you have to figure out what to do with it tim said how do i spend it how do i save it how do i budget how am i going to play because it s very difficult to project how much you re going to earn in an nfl career it might be a one year career and it might be a five year career how the nfl keep it player from going broke 1 58 see what it s like to attend the nfl s personal finance camp which train player on how to make their money last long after they stop playing he said another challenge is that they re only paid during the season except for a small off season stipend we receive eight or nine paycheck throughout the year and you ve got to do all of your budgeting and saving based off of those check it s a little different way of being paid than i think most people are tim said but he also acknowledged that if you have some vision for the future it s a fantastic opportunity in term of investment how they got so smart about money the masthays said their education at the university at kentucky he wa an economics major and she wa a marketing major were helpful and that lesson they learned at a young age were also influential if we ever went on vacation a kid i remember being 6 or 7 and my mom would give me a check register and i would do chore around the house and go wash people s car and save up for my spending money amanda said tim said that at kentucky s business school he took a class in his sophomore year in which he met amanda incidentally and the professor said if you can save 10 000 when you re 20 year old and if the stock market were to return what it s historically returned you d have 1 million when you were 60 i remember thinking wow that s interesting he said that made him think of way he could save some of his scholarship money which wa 750 a month one way he did that wa to live in a utility closet for 100 a month in a house that four of his friend lived in he said it wa just big enough to fit a bed by the time i graduated i had saved 10 000 while living on a scholarship check that s what i bought her wedding ring with he said he spent part of it on the ring tom szczerbowski getty image tim masthay punting in a game against the buffalo bill on dec 14 2014 one mistake tim said one area they could have been smarter in is real estate they bought a house in kentucky for the off season while also owning a home in green bay they ve since sold the kentucky home but say they didn t like owning a home they only used for part of the year marriage and money amanda said one of the reason she wa interested in attending the personal finance camp wa to see what they could do to minimize financial stress during the season finance is one of the biggest element of stress for most people so if there s something we can do that s going to make something else a little bit easier then why wouldn t we want to learn about that and try to implement it in our life during the interview amanda and tim were in agreement on most thing and at time finished each other s sentence when we asked tim what he thought

based on the evidence or lack thereof is there any real science to support astrology there are a few foundational way to evaluate whether a concept is scientific and the university of california

understanding science explains some expectation generated by astrology are so general that any outcome could be interpreted a fitting the expectation if treated this way astrology is not testable 2 doe it rely on evidence there haven t been many study that investigate the science behind astrology but of the few that have the result have failed to support the validity of astrological view for instance a study tested the accuracy of astrological chart in describing the personality trait of 193 study participant and the result indicated that the score were at a level consistent with chance so far it can t be said that astrology relies on replicable scientific evidence and replicability is a must for an idea to prove itself a valid 3 doe it attempt to explain the natural world yes

planet to predict and explain worldly event and human personality however a understanding science explains although astrologer seek to explain the natural world they don t usually attempt to critically evaluate whether those explanation are valid and this is a key part of science plus astrology doesn t lead to ongoing research which is another key part of science so unfortunately for

people can t live without washing their hair each day while others chose to skip a day or two and the difference continue on from there however did you know that some of the most common shower habit might not actually be that healthy believe it or not some of the thing you do every day while taking a shower could be affecting you in way you ve never thought of check out this list to see if your shower habit are doing you more harm than good 1 washing your face without a doubt it s easier and le messy to wash your face when you re already in the shower however despite the convenience it s actually not good for your face the water that you shower in will typically be much hotter than what you d wash with at the sink and the high temperature can make your skin dry out very quickly those with skin condition such a acne or rosacea may also find that washing their face with hot water can cause excessive redness and irritation it could even burst a blood vessel in your face if you wash too aggressively use a gentle cleanser and avoid washing your face in the shower particularly if you have acne prone skin or rosacea 2 not washing your foot you might be thinking that your foot make contact with plenty of water while you re in the shower so there s no real reason to actually bend down and give them a proper wash you d be wrong though even if you re not prone to smelly foot think about how sweaty your foot can get throughout the day not only that but if you re known to walk around the house or outdoors without sock or shoe you never know what you might be picking up along the way there s no excuse for just letting the soap suds run down to your toe anymore imagine what you re bringing into your bed every night without giving those foot a good wash 3 not washing or replacing your loofah regularly be honest how long ha the same loofah been hanging in your shower month year a it turn out that can be terrible for your health this video demonstrates why consider treating yourself to a new sponge or loofah the next time you re out or create a cute and convenient place to hang the one you have for air drying 4 using a soap dish yes that built in soap dish is there forever but using it for it intended purpose actually isn t that good of an idea the majority of people don t use bar of soap these day but for those who do be aware that leaving a bar of soap in one spot could be encouraging bacteria to grow on it bacteria that you re then going to spread over your entire body the next time you lather up if you have reason for resisting the switch to liquid body wash try finding a wire soap dish or one that ha hole in the bottom so any remaining water can drain away once you re out of the shower 5 using scented soap yes those soap that make your bathroom smell like a tropical rainforest or a freshly made vanilla cupcake do transport you to a place of olfactory luxury while sudsing up but those very fragrance could be doing a number on your skin at the same time anyone who notice their skin seems particularly irritated after a shower should look to their soap a the first culprit fragrance can irritate sensitive skin very easily so it s best to use something unscented to keep your skin in the best shape plus you won t have to worry about the scent of your soap mixing with the scent of your perfume to create questionable smell 6 showering in hard water some people may not even know how to tell if their water is considered hard but figuring it out and taking step to adjust it could save your hair and skin from a lot of damage hard water is defined by it high concentration of mineral like magnesium and calcium which can end up making your skin break out or cause a layer of buildup on your hair those with dyed hair may even find that hard water strip the color out of their strand or at least cause their tint to fade a little quicker if you re unable to add a water softener to your shower try incorporating a clarifying shampoo into your routine to remove any buildup caused by those pesky mineral 7 avoiding cold shower most people wouldn t even dream of standing in cold water for more than a second let alone taking an entire shower in water that s anything le than steaming hot still cold water shower can actually be really beneficial for your skin and hair and you only need 30 second under a cold stream to see a difference a quick blast of cold water is said to improve your immune function increase your metabolism and increase the amount of stress you can tolerate in addition to speeding up your metabolism a study done in 2009 suggests that regularly taking a cold shower could even help you lose weight over time 8 using old razor for most of u old razor aren t something we thoughtfully replace on a regular basis instead they just sit in the shower until we finally cave and get a new one razor whether you re buying replacement head or the kind that are entirely disposable are surprisingly expensive so why throw one out after a certain period of time if it still seems to work well just because a razor is shaving off your unwanted hair doesn t mean it s doing so effectively if you notice that your skin get red and inflamed after you shave it s because the blade are dull and it s time for a replacement 9 leaving your razor in the shower remember how leaving your wet bar of soap in your dingy old soap dish make it a breeding ground for bacteria the same thing go for your razor there are plenty of nook and cranny in your razor that make perfect spot for bacteria to hide and the problem will only get worse when the razor is sitting in a warm wet environment if you don t actually want to store your razor outside of the shower at least make sure that you hang it up when you re done using it so it can air dry 10 over exfoliating giving your skin a gentle scrub every now and then is a good idea but doing so every day could actually be causing damage for anyone who doesn t know your skin actually exfoliates itself by renewing every 27 day or so anyone who chooses to exfoliate their skin every day is aggressively going after fresh skin cell which can make your skin red and irritated a a result it s best to let some dead cell build up on the surface of your skin before reaching for your favorite scrub so that you know there s actually something there worth

lindenbaum who continues to write about the epidemic knew it couldn t be genetic because it affected woman and child in the same social group but not in the same genetic group she also knew that it had started in village in the north around the turn of the century and then moved south over the decade lindenbaum had a hunch about what wa going on and she turned out to be right it had to do with funeral specifically it had to do with eating dead body at funeral in many village when a person died they would be cooked and consumed it wa an act of love and grief a one medical researcher a one medical researcher described if the body wa buried it wa eaten by worm if it wa placed on a platform it wa eaten by maggot the fore believed it wa much better that the body wa eaten by people who loved the deceased than by worm and insect woman removed the brain woman removed the brain mixed it with fern and cooked it in tube of bamboo they fire roasted and ate everything except the gall bladder it wa primarily adult woman who did so say lindenbaum because their body were thought to be capable of housing and taming the dangerous spirit that would accompany a dead body so the woman took on the role of consuming the dead body and giving it a safe place inside their own body taming it for a period of time during this dangerous period of mortuary ceremony say lindenbaum but woman would occasionally pas piece of the feast to child snack say lindenbaum they ate what their mother gave them she say until the boy hit a certain age and went off to live with the men then they were told not to touch that stuff finally after urging from researcher like lindenbaum biologist came around to the idea that the strange disease stemmed from eating dead people the case wa closed after a

a twisted protein capable of performing the microscopic equivalent of a jedi mind trick compelling normal protein on the surface of nerve cell in the brain to contort just like them the so called

odd that the process wa so odd that some compared it to dr jekyll s transformation to mr hyde the same entity but in two manifestation a kind innocuous one and a vicious lethal one the epidemic likely

is definitive evidence that human can develop a prion disease after eating the infected meat of another specie but he say there are still a lot of open question about how and why human get prion disease for one it s still a mystery why animal including human have those protein in the first place the jekylls that can be so easily turned into hydes one leading hypothesis nature is that they play an important role in the protective coating around nerve for one it s still a mystery why animal including human have those protein in the first place the jekylls that can be so easily turned

of these disease actually jump specie and affect human kuru showed that people could get a prion disease from eating infected people mad cow disease showed that people can get a prion disease from eating infected cow but what about other prion disease in other animal could say hunter get sick from eating infected deer that s what researcher in north america including belay are trying to find out right now chronic wasting disease in north america is spreading fast say belay the disease cause infected wild deer and elk to starve to death in early 2000 we had about three state that reported cwd in the wild in deer and elk today that number is 21 belay say the disease is a little bit concerning because unlike mad cow disease and kuru where infectious prion were concentrated in the brain and nervous system tissue in an animal with chronic wasting disease the misfolded prion show up all over the body they can even be found in saliva feces and urine which could explain how the disease is spreading so quickly among wild deer and elk the cdc is working with public health authority in wyoming and colorado to monitor hunter for sign of prion disease unfortunately because these disease have long incubation period it s not easy to monitor transmission say belay he say he and his colleague have yet to find any evidence that hunter have picked up chronic wasting disease from the meat

mother had been the one to decide with her doctor s blessing to stop pursuing the dwindling chemo option and she had been the one to ask her doctor to call hospice still we weren t prepared for the nurse s question my mother and i exchanged glance a little shocked but what we felt most wa a sense of relief during six and a half year of treatment although my mother saw two general practitioner six oncologist a cardiologist several radiation technician nurse at two chemotherapy facility and surgeon at three different clinic not once to my knowledge had anyone talked to her about what would happen a she died there s good reason roughly from the last two week until the last breath somewhere in that interval people become too sick or too drowsy or too unconscious to tell u what they re experiencing say margaret campbell a professor of nursing at wayne state university who ha worked in palliative care for decade the way death is talked about tends to be based on what family friend and medical professional see rather than account of what dying actually feel like james hallenbeck a palliative care specialist at stanford university often compare dying to black hole we can see the effect of black hole but it is extremely difficult if not impossible to look inside them they exert an increasingly strong gravitational pull the closer one get to them a one pass the event horizon apparently the law of physic begin to change what doe dying feel like despite a growing body of research about death the actual physical experience of dying the last few day or moment remains shrouded in mystery medicine is just beginning to peek beyond the horizon until about 100 year ago almost all dying happened quickly but modern medicine ha radically changed how long the end of life can be stretched now american who have access to medical care often die gradually of lingering disease like most terminal cancer or complication from diabetes or dementia rather than quickly from say a farm accident or the flu according to the center for disease control s most recent figure american are most likely to die of heart disease cancer or chronic pulmonary lung disease pre death dream were frequently so intense that the dream carried into wakefulness for those who do die gradually there s often a final rapid slide that happens in roughly the last few day of life a phase known a active dying during this time hallenbeck writes in palliative care perspective his guide to palliative care for physician people tend to lose their sens and desire in a certain order first hunger and then thirst are lost speech is lost next followed by vision the last sens to go are usually hearing and touch whether dying is physically painful or how painful it is appears to vary there are some kind of condition where pain is inevitable campbell say there are some patient that just get really really old and just fade away and there s no distress having a disease associated with pain doesn t mean you ll necessarily endure a difficult death either most people dying of cancer need pain medication to keep them comfortable campbell note and the medicine usually work if they re getting a good comprehensive pain regimen they can die peacefully she say when people become too weak to cough or swallow some start to make a noise in the back of their throat the sound can be deeply disturbing a if the patient is suffering but that s not what it feel like to the person dying a far a doctor can tell in fact medical researcher believe that the phenomenon which is commonly called a death rattle probably doesn t hurt ultimately because most people lose awareness or consciousness in their last few hour or day it s hard to know for certain how much patient are suffering we generally believe that if your brain is really in a comatose kind of situation or you re not really responsive that your perception how you feel about thing may also be significantly decreased say david hui an oncologist and palliative care specialist who research the sign of approaching death you may or may not even be aware of what s happening a week or two after we spoke to the nurse my mother sank into a state where she wa rarely conscious when she wa awake it wa only the most basic part of her that wa there the part that told her leg to move to get her to the bathroom the automated step in brushing her teeth and then wiping the sink afterward her mind turned away from her child and husband for the first time i wanted to know what she wa thinking about i wanted to know where her mind wa being at the bedside of an unresponsive dying person can feel like trying to find out whether someone is home by looking through thick curtained window is the person sleeping dreaming experiencing something supernatural is her mind gone for many dying people the brain doe the same thing that the body doe in that it start to sacrifice area which are le critical to survival say david hovda director of the ucla brain injury research center he compare the breakdown to what happens in aging people tend to lose their ability for complex or executive planning learning motor skill and in what turn out to be a very important function inhibition the wave get higher and higher and eventually they carry the person out to sea a the brain begin to change and start to die different part become excited and one of the part that becomes excited is the visual system hovda explains and so that s where people begin to see light recent research point to evidence that the sharpening of the sens some people report also seems to match what we know about the brain s response to dying jimo borjigin a neuroscientist at the university of michigan first became intrigued by this subject when she noticed something strange in the brain of animal in another experiment just before the animal died neurochemical in the brain suddenly surged while scientist had known that brain neuron continued to fire after a person died this wa different the neuron were secreting new chemical and in large amount a lot of cardiac arrest survivor describe that during their unconscious period they have this amazing experience in their brain she say they see light and then they describe the experience a realer than real she realized the sudden release of neurochemical might help to explain this feeling borjigin and her research team tried an experiment they anesthetized eight rat and then stopped their heart suddenly all the different region of the brain became synchronized she say the rat brain showed higher power in different frequency wave and also what is known a coherence the electrical activity from different part of the brain working together if you re focusing attention doing something trying to figure out a word or trying to remember a face when you re doing high level cognitive activity these feature go up borjigin say these are well used parameter in studying human consciousness in awake human so we thought if you re alert or aroused similar parameter should also go up in the dying brain in fact that wa the case in her last couple of week when my mother s mind seemed to be floating off somewhere else most of the time she would sometimes lift her arm into the air plucking at invisible object with her finger once i captured her hand in mine and asked what she d been doing putting thing away she answered smiling dreamily this half dreaming half waking state is common in dying people in fact researcher led by christopher kerr at a hospice center outside buffalo new york conducted a study of dying people s dream most of the patient interviewed 88 percent had at least one dream or vision and those dream usually felt different to them from normal dream for one thing the dream seemed clearer more real the patient pre death dream were frequently so intense that the dream carried into wakefulness and the dying often experienced them a waking reality the researcher write in the journal of palliative medicine seventy two percent of the patient dreamed about reuniting with people who had already died fifty nine percent said they dreamed about getting ready to travel somewhere twenty eight percent dreamed about meaningful experience in the past patient were interviewed every day so the same people often reported dream about multiple subject for most of the patient the dream were comforting and positive the researcher say the dream often helped decrease the fear of death the predominant quality of pre death dream vision wa a sense of personal meaning which

people that they are going to die the reminder aren t explicit and they probably aren t part of an intentional strategy all the same much of trump s rhetoric could have the effect of bringing his viewer omnipresent fear of death closer to their conscious mind according to sheldon solomon a psychologist at skidmore college in saratoga spring n y that includes his emphasis on terrorism unsurprisingly but also his preoccupation with immigration this focus might be helping trump since solomon s recent research show that people who are thinking about death are more likely to say they support him study subject who were prompted to talk about their own death later rated their support for trump 1 66 point higher on a five point scale than those who were prompted to talk about pain generally i m not suggesting that any of this is calculated but almost everything that he doe is demonstrably effective for raising these non conscious existential concern that in turn make his kind of candidacy all the more alluring solomon said solomon is part of a group of researcher that ha spent decade investigating the connection between death and a broad variety of human belief and

solomon said he and his colleague have tried to supply that proof through experimentation their research is still preliminary and controversial and they haven t worked out a complete theory but they have discovered a number of startling fact about how people think about death for example solomon and florette cohen of the city university of new york college of staten island recently found evidence that asking people to think about immigrant also get them thinking about death solomon and cohen asked a small group of volunteer at the college of staten island to respond to one of three prompt one group wa asked to write down what they thought would happen in a much detail a possible if immigrant moved into their neighborhood and what emotion they would feel the other two group were asked to answer the same question but about their own death and about feeling intense pain instead of about immigration then the two researcher gave the participant a set of word with letter missing and asked them to fill in the blank to get an idea of what the participant were thinking about shown c o f f _ _ for example many people might write coffee especially student in college if they were thinking about death however they might write coffin instead the participant who had been asked to think about immigration had death on their mind too almost to the same extent a those who had been asked to think about death explicitly assigned score from zero to one based on how many word related to death they produced those who had been asked to think about immigration scored 0 92 on average while those who had been asked to think about death scored 0 96 those asked to think about pain scored just 0 19 there wa no evidence that the effect wa greater for conservative participant in the study solomon said he hope to replicate the study which wa completed with a small group of a few dozen student at the college of staten island yet the result accord with those of similar study that suggest people interpret challenge to their culture a threat to their very existence yet the result accord with those of similar study that suggest people interpret challenge to their culture a threat to their very existence a different group of researcher found that after a group of canadian read an article in which canadian cultural trope were mocked they were thinking about death too the pattern extends to religious belief the pattern extends to religious belief another study found a comparable effect in atheist confronted with argument in favor of intelligent design and a third concluded that pointing out logical inconsistency in the bible made thought of death also more accessible to fundamentalist christian for solomon the research suggests that when people create meaning in their life whether through religion nationality or staying at home with a 30 pack of beer and spraying some cheez whiz on a cracker in solomon s word they are protecting themselves from their constant awareness of death he and his colleague for solomon the research suggests that when people create meaning in their life whether through religion nationality or staying at home with a 30 pack of beer

do basic thing like use public transportation or a cell phone can feel like a herculean task according to the national institute of justice over 60 percent of ex con are jobless up to a year after release that said getting a job is a necessary step for prisoner to integrate back into society often time it s a requirement by the criminal justice system or else freshly released inmate will risk being sent back to the fed but even when ex con do manage to get hired the work is underpaid demoralizing and their employer don t do much to encourage the re entry process there are organizer that

restaurant despite my earning two college degree while in prison the work sucked and i wa forced to do the grunt work no one else would do like clean out the fryer every night i wasn t in any position

with an extremely bad vaginal prolapse i called my bos and he called the vet who came out at four in the morning i had to lift the cow s vaginal inside and hold them while the vet tried to stuff them back inside the cow after about an hour and a half of lifting and stuffing this slimy nasty thing the vet finally got it all back inside and sewed up when i did my final inspection of the morning at 10 am the cow had died all that work wa for nothing having to stick my entire arm in a cow to help pull out a calf wa not fun either you work super hard to pull one of the slimy thing out and then you have to scoop the little thing up and take off before the cow attack you for holding it calf having a 1 200 pound animal chase you is a little intimidating i had two coworkers that knew about my criminal situation they asked a lot of question stuff about what wa prison like and what i did to get all that time my bos wa a good bos he helped me get my class a driver s license so i could drive truck for him he wa a big help and wa instrumental in me getting the job i have now the farm wa a tight knit family so i wa treated well but the work wa completely horrible it prepared me for the

ankle the halfway house didn t provide transportation to the job and i had to walk there every morning it wa a seven mile walk that took over two hour i had to be there at seven in the morning and got off at 4 pm with only a short lunch break in between with my first paycheck i bought a bike and then it only took me forty minute to get to work i wa making about 50 buck a day but i wa required to give 25 percent to the halfway house if i bought a soda or cigarette i wa almost broke it took me two month in the halfway house to save up and buy a 500 car i worked there because it wa the only job available nobody wanted the job because of the stink and the dust blowing on you from the trash truck no one else would take these job besides ex con at the halfway house and all the other ex con that worked there would sleep on a nearby hill or smoke k2 all day while i wa working i wa alienated out there it wa one of the most degrading experience i ever went through but i got past it it sure didn t help me become a better person cause i wa still the same after i ve had four job since i ve been out and i never told anyone i wa on parole until after i wa hired or they wouldn t have hired me i

the bos one dude even jumped up picked up a computer and slammed it down because he couldn t get anybody to donate he walked out shortly after but most ex con needed the job to get out of the halfway house so they just kept working there until something better came along i quit that job when i had something better lined up it served it purpose because if you don t have a gig you have to stay at

and evolution of our world a well a those in the inner solar system we need to understand the timing of major event during the planet formation era bottke said to find out more about this giant impact scientist developed a computer model of the event they found that the impact not only created a disk of debris near earth that formed the moon but it also ejected huge amount of rubble a much a several percent of earth s mass away from earth and the moon the simulation found that numerous fragment from the moon forming impact hundred of million of which were at least a mile 1 6 kilometer

the innocent bystander were the main belt asteroid collision against these asteroid in more recent time returned these remnant to earth in stony meteorite which the scientist now have analyzed and used to date the age of the impact in a sense the asteroid belt ha been an eyewitness to multiple drive by shooting from the earliest time in solar system history bottke said by reading the trace left behind we can use asteroid sample to tell u who did it when they did it and how they did it the researcher deduced that the moon forming impact occurred about 4 47 billion year ago in agreement with

of the holy grail of geology we have no rock older than 4 billion year old on earth and no one know the exact nature of the original building block of our planet if future research can uncover example

change of scenery nancy reagan famously told critic of her husband s regular trip to the family s ranch work especially in this digital age follows you around still it s worth noting this moment and that s because it speaks to obama s unique and long lasting commitment to not playing by a core rule of modern politics making at least some decision based on how it look and or how it will play obama ha long been a rejectionist on this front his stubborn refusal to rebut claim regarding what wa in the affordable care act badly hamstrung his party s attempt to win the fight for public perception on

state militant group which is also known a isi and isil capture his view on perception politics nicely for a while now the main contribution of some of my friend on the other side of the aisle have made in the fight against isil is to criticize this administration and me for not using the phrase radical islam that s the key they tell u we can t beat isil unless we call them radical islamist what exactly would using this label accomplish what exactly would it change would it make isil le committed to trying to kill american would it bring in more ally is there a military strategy that is served by this the answer is none of the above calling a threat by a different name doe not make it go away this is a political distraction there ha not been a moment in my seven and a half year a president where we have not been able to pursue a strategy because we didn t use the label radical islam not once ha an adviser of mine said man if we really use that phrase we re going to turn this

a salmon tuna and sardine according to the study published last week nov 16 in the nutrition journal the most significant source of arsenic in most people s diet is drinking water the new study is the first to take into account the level of arsenic in the participant household water when looking at the amount of arsenic coming from food the result suggest that diet can be an important source of people s arsenic exposure over the long term regardless of arsenic concentration in their drinking water the researcher said the element arsenic occurs naturally in the environment long term exposure

arsenic in drinking water to 10 microgram per litter for drinking water but there are few limit set for food 5 thing you should know about arsenic in the study the arsenic level in the participant household tap water were well below the epa limit at 0 30 microgram per liter on average however 52 participant had tap water arsenic level higher than the epa s limit the arsenic level in participant toenail were 0 12 microgram per gram on average however it is unclear what level of concentration found in toenail sample might signal an unsafe level of arsenic exposure said study author kathryn cottingham researcher at dartmouth college in new hampshire the toenail measurement in the study served only a a way to compare level among people the researcher said people who reported drinking on average two and half beer or a glass of white wine every day had arsenic level 20 to 30 percent higher than those of people who didn t drink the study wasn t designed to find why higher consumption of beer and wine wa linked to higher arsenic level but a few scenario are possible cottingham said 7 way alcohol affect your health one possibility is that the ingredient in beer and wine are high in arsenic it is also possible that arsenic is added during the filtration process that give beer and wine their sparkly clear look a one recent study suggested cottingham said and lastly alcohol itself may be to blame for the higher arsenic level by impairing the body s ability to detoxify arsenic the mechanism that our body use to try to get rid of the stuff that is not good for u can be impaired by alcohol consumption cottingham said the researcher didn t find a link between arsenic level and intake of rice which is thought to be relatively high in arsenic but in line with previous study they found that the more dark meat fish people ate the higher were their arsenic level people who ate dark meat fish once a week had about a 7 percent higher arsenic concentration in their toenail compared with people who consumed these fish le than once a month although some food are high in arsenic people don t need to avoid them entirely cottingham said probably the best way to avoid exposure from diet is to mix it up in the food and not eat the same thing every day it s also important to keep water source safe she said if someone is drinking water from a private well they should get it tested

it won t fit into his pocket it s large and it s impractical clark said where s he going to put it this underscore a simple truth epipens just aren t that great they re reliable sure they ll buy a patient who s in the midst of a severe allergic reaction a few crucial minute to make his way to the hospital but they re also bulky their epinephrine solution isn t particularly shelf stable and will easily degrade in temperature that are too low or too high they expire after about a year and they re not so user friendly though epipens come with a practice kit user in the midst of an allergy attack have mistaken which end s the pointy end and stabbed their thumb instead of their thigh the device have come under fire in the past month for their escalating sticker price a pack of two epipens now list for 608 mylan which owns the epipen brand though the device itself is actually manufactured by pfizer note that it redesigned the product in 2009 added feature including the flip top case and is investing substantial amount in research into additional improvement such a a formulation with a longer shelf life but critic say mylan ha little incentive to improve epipens if you re the monopolist and you ve got a product that expires every year and it s not super easy to carry around so the safest thing to do is have several tucked away in different place i don t see why there would be any pressure to innovate said nicholson price an assistant professor at the university of michigan law school who study health care regulation and patent law epipen s flaw seem like feature not a bug price said competitor have tried to make run at the epipen and more are trying now that there s such a spotlight on the product but it s unclear if anything can displace the familiar auto injector with the bright orange cap here s why 1 mylan ha patent protection that last through 2025 epinephrine a a drug wa first synthesized more than a century ago it s been used for various medical application since then and wa first packaged in an auto injector to protect soldier against chemical warfare back in the 1970s but mylan ha a lock on the particular epipen design that million of patient parent and school nurse have come to trust the company s main innovation ha been a bright orange cap that cover the needle but release automatically when a patient push an epipen against her thigh so there s no need to stop and unscrew the cover in the midst of an allergy attack the very fact that the epipen ha been dominant for so long make it hard for challenger to come in with a radically different design mylan is now pledging to make a generic version which it say will be identical except for the label if you re a parent and your child s suffering from an allergic reaction you have to give them an injection and don t want to read the instruction in that moment said matthew allen head of drug delivery for cambridge consultant you just have to know how to use it allen s work at cambridge consultant center around designing other form of auto injector he said the food and drug administration ha rule to standardize the way these life saving device work those rule keep consumer safe but they also make it difficult to come up with design that can meet the standard without infringing on mylan s patent it would not be very difficult to create an epipen product in term of engineering allen said it s not rocket science it s purely the patent that stop u 2 there s no room for error when you re treating anaphylaxis chris stepanian is ceo of windgap medical a boston startup that s been working on a next generation epinephrine auto injector for the past five year windgap s device is meant to improve upon the epipen it s supposed to be smaller about the size of a bic lighter with a much more stable formulation of epinephrine intended to survive in a pant pocket without getting overheated but that s proving easier said than done stepanian said he s at least a few year away from bringing his newfangled auto injector to market though epipen component look pretty basic mylan note that it is made up of 26 part and must be able to deliver the drug with a sterile needle within second stepanian agrees that it s more complicated than it seems at first glance it s really challenging to make a reliable auto injector and surprisingly hard to make a combination drug product he said it s a tough thing to nail down the drug supply chain the plastic and design and then incorporate that all together and put the drug inside it and then regardless of how the user us it get the appropriate dose within the acceptable limit of the fda stepanian added at least mylan and pfizer have done a good job of making a pretty reliable one one epipen alternative that did make it to market the auvi q an epinephrine auto injector shaped like a bulky credit card but sanofi recalled the device last year over concern that patient weren t getting the correct dose every time it returned the commercial and marketing right to kaleo from whom it licensed the auto injector in 2009 a representative from kaleo said that it s in the process of evaluating when and how to bring the auvi q back to the market but sanofi is no longer involved 3 it doesn t take an auto injector to get epinephrine into the body but it sure help in the wake of the recent outrage at mylan los angeles based mannkind corporation announced it s developing an inhalable form of epinephrine we could make something very tiny that you could carry on a keychain much smaller than an epipen or auto injector by far mannkind ceo matthew pfeffer said mannkind already ha an inhalable insulin product called afrezza on the market which give diabetic an alternative to injection but it s proved exceedingly tough to get patient to switch from a format of insulin intake they re familiar with to an inhaler sale have been far below expectation the same problem could stymie an epinephrine inhaler especially since one of the frightening feature of an anaphylactic attack is that the airway constrict which in theory anyway could make it hard for a patient to use the inhaler in a moment of crisis 4 the regulatory process is slow and expensive a lot of the challenge lie in the regulatory system said mark baum ceo of san diego based imprimis a compound pharmaceutical company that s working on a cheaper alternative to the epipen it can take a long time and a lot of money to get fda approval for a new product the only time it make economic sense to take the risk of going through these clinical trial is when you have a situation like this baum said but when the market wa more normalized when the epipen wa only retailing around 100 competitor questioned whether it wa worth taking that risk public anger at epipen is so high right now that baum figure it is worth taking the risk imprimis ha had it eye on the epinephrine auto injector market for about two year now it s finally going to go for it we re just focused on being that competition he said 5 the public hasn t spoken loud enough denise clark whose son ha that peanut allergy is a consultant with boston medtech advisor she help medical device company with design market analysis and regulatory strategy but though she work in the field every day she say she never even thought much about the flaw of the epipen design or the lack of innovation until the product started hitting headline it s something that s always been irritating to me but not to the point that i ve looked at it closely until i had to start paying all this money clark said granted the federal trade commission ha been fielding complaint about mylan s pricing for year and complaint about the device s clunkiness are no secret but since the epipen is generally covered by insurance many customer have simply gone with it that mean there s been little pressure from the paying public for innovation i guess mylan s motto is if it ain t broke don t fix

widespread outrage by saying he would keep the nation in suspense about whether he will accept the result of the election next month but sir there is a tradition in this country in fact one of the pride of this country is the peaceful transition of power and that no matter how hard fought a campaign is that at the end of the campaign that the loser concedes to the winner said moderator chris wallace not saying that you re necessarily going to be the loser or the winner but that the loser concedes to the winner and that the country come together in part for the good of the country indeed the nation s ability to regularly and peacefully replace the president wa to the world of the 1700s one of the most striking element of the american experiment a john adam himself wrote to his wife upon his becoming the second president in 1797 the transfer of power wa the sublimest thing ever exhibited in america but while adam wa the first to experience that transition it wasn t until four year later that the principle wa put to the test after all george washington didn t want to run again for the 1796 election and adam kept power within the same party in 1800 on the other hand the united state saw it first hotly contested election and it first transfer of power between political party the result wa close and it also left thomas jefferson and aaron burr tied with the house spending a week deciding who would be president at the time the vice president wa whoever came in second it wa easily conceivable that the entire system would fall apart but instead jefferson became president and his rival the incumbent adam a well a burr accepted the result a jefferson would later write the revolution of 1800 wa a big deal it wa a real a revolution in the principle of our government a that of 1776 wa in it form not effected indeed by the sword a that but by the rational and peaceable instrument of reform the suffrage of the people the nation declared it will by dismissing functionary of one principle and electing those of another in the two branch executive and legislative submitted to their election this principle that the nation declares it will by voting and the functionary of government peacefully accept the choice ha even been upheld when perhaps the candidate might have wished to do otherwise for example some believe that the 1960 presidential election wa subject to substantial enough voting irregularity that richard nixon should have won in fact there is no concrete evidence either way but even though it wa an extremely close race and some of his supporter urged him to fight the result nixon decided that in keeping with tradition it wa better to accept the fact that early return indicated john f kennedy had won in a late night speech to supporter he explained why a all of you in this room know and a all of you million who are listening on television and radio realize it is normally the custom for a candidate for the presidency not to appear until after the decision is definitely known and all the vote are counted beyond doubt however i have been keeping some pretty late hour recently a some of you have i know too that many who are listening in the eastern part of the united state will find that it is now about 3 15 in the morning i want to say that one of the great feature of america is that we have political contest that they are very hard fought a this one wa hard fought and once the decision is made we unite behind the man who is elected i want senator kennedy to know and i want all of you to know that certainly if this trend continues and if he doe become our next president he will have my whole hearted support that tradition even held true in 2000 a time s david von drehle ha pointed out that year s concession from al gore to george w bush wa a long time in coming not because gore refused to accept the result of the vote but because there wa no result to accept yet in fact when it became clear what the result would be gore followed the precedent of hundred of year worth of election a he peacefully accepted the outcome of the vote a he explained in his concession speech that wa what patriotism required

to the gentleman of this article jason brian rosenthal he is an easy man to fall in love with i did it in one day let me explain my father s best friend since summer camp uncle john had known jason and me separately our whole life but jason and i had never met i went to college out east and took my first job in california when i moved back home to chicago john who thought jason and i were perfect for each other set u up on a blind date it wa 1989 we were only 24 i had precisely zero expectation about this going anywhere but when he knocked on the door of my little frame house i thought uh oh there is something highly likable about this person by the end of dinner i knew i wanted to marry him jason he knew a year later i have never been on tinder bumble or eharmony but i m going to create a general profile for jason right here based on my experience of coexisting in the same house with him for like 9 490 day first the basic he is 5 foot 10 160 pound with salt and pepper hair and hazel eye the following list of attribute is in no particular order because everything feel important to me in some way he is a sharp dresser our young adult son justin and mile often borrow his clothes those who know him or just happen to glance down at the gap between his dress slack and dress shoe know that he ha a flair for fabulous sock he is fit and enjoys keeping in shape if our home could speak it would add that jason is uncannily handy on the subject of food man can he cook after a long day there is no sweeter joy than seeing him walk in the door plop a grocery bag down on the counter and woo me with olive and some yummy cheese he ha procured before he get to work on the evening s meal jason love listening to live music it s our favorite thing to do together i should also add that our 19 year old daughter paris would rather go to a concert with him than anyone else when i wa working on my first memoir i kept circling section my editor wanted me to expand upon she would say i d like to see more of this character get lifestyle news from the style travel and food section from the latest trend to news you can use of course i would agree he wa indeed a captivating

you jason is compassionate and he can flip a pancake jason paint i love his artwork i would call him an artist except for the law degree that keep him at his downtown office most day from 9 to 5 or at least it did before i got sick if you re looking for a dreamy let s go for it travel companion jason is your man he also ha an affinity for tiny thing taster spoon little jar a mini sculpture of a couple sitting on a bench which he presented to me a a reminder of how our family began here is the kind of man jason is he showed up at our first pregnancy ultrasound with flower this is a man who because he is always up early surprise me every sunday morning by making some kind of oddball smiley face out of item near the coffeepot a spoon a mug a banana this is a man who emerges from the minimart or gas station and say give me your palm and voila a colorful gumball appears he know i love all the flavor but white my guess is you know enough about him now so let s swipe right wait did i mention that he is incredibly handsome i m going to miss looking at that face of his if he sound like a prince and our relationship seems like a fairy tale it s not too far off except for all of the regular stuff that come from two and a half decade of playing house together and the part about me getting cancer blech in my most recent memoir written entirely before my diagnosis i invited reader to send in suggestion for matching tattoo the idea being that author and reader would be bonded by ink i wa totally serious about this and encouraged submitter to be serious a well hundred poured in a few week after publication in august i heard from a 62 year old librarian in milwaukee named paulette she suggested the word more this wa based on an essay in the book where i mention that more wa my

you don t talk to the conscious rodriguez say that s the one that really listens the girl slept hot dog style cocooned in tightly wrapped sheet to keep out the vermin they occasionally woke up during

include a judge a public health official and an entrepreneur and the gay sibling write book and run company and design bridge the dungey sister grew into an actor and a television executive one lin sibling designed the vietnam veteran memorial the other ha written 12 book each of these family is different in thousand of way from their ethnicity to their income to their sleepover policy but we set out to find the way they are the same in selecting candidate to study we ignored sibling who do the same work in the same industry like venus and serena williams and family that come from a great fortune or legacy like the trump or the kennedy we looked for family in which all the sibling did well and we defined success by leadership service or achievement not just fame or money alone of course genetics play a role for every family but we focused on upbringing and sibling dynamic instead some of the consistency are fairly predictable while none of these sibling grew up rich they were privileged in many other way they had involved parent and lot of opportunity and most saw college a achievable even inevitable they weren t abused or neglected and none grew up in abject want they didn t have an unfair head start but they were spared some of the most difficult obstacle faced by le fortunate kid but other commonality are more specific and more telling of the nine family eight had a parent who wa an immigrant or an educator and five had a parent who wa both many parent were involved in political activism of some kind most recall a conflict heavy family life but that conflict wa rarely between the parent many had a strong awareness of mortality a child and most said they grew up with much more freedom than their friend did we talked to mayor and poet and judge and

srinivasan child sri srija and srinija played basketball and went shopping and rode dirt bike but they didn t have chore in the same way their friend did in the srinivasan household le wa required but more wa expected there wa no one person responsible for the trash or dish it wa more like look around what s mom doing doe she need help recall srinija the youngest put thing away pay attention also nobody got an allowance instead a drawer in the living room table contained petty cash for anyone to use on the one hand it meant great permissiveness that is way better than an allowance say srinija on the other hand responsibility for every choice her older sister srija put it this way if i took 20 that meant sri and srinija couldn t go to the movie the srinivasan family left and right courtesy of the srinivasan family the three kid now adult say they grew up understanding that the family wa more important than the individual a realization made especially poignant by the fact that their

hegger photography awareness of the im migrant experience compounded by the fact that the gay were often the only black family on their block led to tough rule and high standard success and performance wa not a choice that wa an expectation michael gay sr say good grade in school that wa not something to make a big fit about no one received a gold star from general gay and his attache nicole a joel call them being from haiti in particular meant that there wa a distinct honor to uphold they were very proud of our history that we were the first black nation in the western hemisphere say roxane add joel the more impoverished the country from whence you come the more emboldened one s work ethic is he say his parent and the awareness of their sacrifice created an extreme intolerance for underperformance within oneself parent teacher on another university campus far from the srinivasans in kansa esther wojcicki wa having a pool party her husband stan wa chair of the physic

of everything say anne universally acknowledged a the best shopper of the bunch they immediately start mocking anne for bringing her own kale to breakfast mimicking janet s high school cheerleading routine anne know it by heart and passing around a video of anne dancing in a hula skirt on a family vacation when you have three girl together it wa already a party janet say growing up surrounded by their dad s physic buddy had it drawback on their school vacation the girl were usually dragged to physic conference where they would torment the world famous scientist they threw paper airplane during presentation hurled small object off hotel balcony and even came up with an elaborate fashion consulting prank to trick academic into changing their ugly tie but the academic environment also instilled a comfort with complex idea and a confidence in asking question because we grew up with a lot of strong academic i think one of the skill we have is not being intimidated say susan it s never like oh this person is so important i can t challenge him the wojcicki family left courtesy of the wojcicki family right cody pickens for time esther had begun her daughter ed ucation long before they were peppering stanford physicist with question about nuclear particle after working a a teacher and playground supervisor in the 1960s she began to suspect that early childhood education wa more crucial than anyone then thought my theory wa that the most important year were 0 to 5 she say it wa a gut feeling so i made everything into a game she did art and craft project with her toddler daughter took them to the library every week and taught them how to read count and swim before they even set foot in a classroom of course developmental expert have now proved esther right the first few year of a child s life are among the most important for learning and brain development and between stan s academic universe and esther s educational parenting another commonality emerges seven of the nine family had a parent who wa a teacher not all taught at the university level though three family had at least one professor a a parent the nine family also included parent who were elementary school teacher a preschool painting instructor a doctor who taught medical student a former french teacher and a school administrator who taught a night course on black history it may be that the job itself wa le important than the educational mind set parent in these family instinctively under stood the importance of at home instruction decade before researcher established the merit of early education their child recalled early supplementary lesson book read aloud regular library trip and even at home worksheet to give them an early boost in school this clearly helped the dungey sister abc entertainment group president channing dungey is the first black president of a major television network and her sister merrin dungey is a well known actor with major role on once upon a time and alias she will appear on conviction this fall their mother had been an elementary school teacher before channing wa born and she applied her classroom skill to raising her two daughter in sacramento she would draw line of face like three happy face and one sad face three triangle and one square and then there s my little crayon mark marking the one that wa wrong recall channing who learned to read when she wa 2 year old we never went to preschool because we didn t have to merrin add the dungey family left and right courtesy of the dungey family for the srinivasans having a parent who wa an educator created an unspoken expectation of academic achievement that wa almost a powerful a familial love you probably have somewhere in the back of your mind that you don t want to disappoint your teacher in the same way you don t want to disappoint your parent say sri there wa just no other way to think political activism on most night the three emanuel boy would adjourn their ritual fistfight and flop on their mother s bed to hear a story but sometimes she didn t come home marsha emanuel wa occasionally arrested a she demonstrated against segregation in 1960s chicago on those night the boy bickered over the top bunk while marsha waited behind bar the emanuels would go on to become the stuff of legend and are often called the jewish kennedy bioethicist zeke is a vice

rahm recall sitting in the briefing room of the chicago mayor s office just eating dinner wa a test of current event the brother also have a much younger adopted sister shoshana video by diane tsai for time that political engagement created a sense that the world wa malleable and that the boy through their action could be the one to shape it you could by protesting or coming up with idea actually change the world i think that s a very important message say zeke it s not that it will change necessarily but the world can change and that you have a responsibility to try to make a change political activism wa a common theme for the parent in these family many of them were outspoken in their demand for reform in city school and housing complex and never just for the benefit of their own child while none of the parent held high political office their involvement ranged from demonstrating for civil right to union organizing to demanding that city build new park or that university treat low wage worker fairly when they weren t pushing for reform they were mediating heated political debate at home the emanuel family left courtesy of the emanuel family right brooke collins city of chicago daniel simmons sr also found himself arrested during civil right demonstration he worked a a new york city school attendance superintendent by day and taught a college course on black history by night his young son remember waving goodbye a he boarded a bus from queen to see martin luther king jr at the march on washington in 1963 they stood with him on picket line and visited his class on radical politics and they were watching when he lay down in front of a bulldozer to protest a segregated construction site now adult they say their father s activism showed them how to get involved in the world outside themselves he had his own moral compass he knew what wa right and what wa fair and he demanded that kind of justice say russell simmons of his father it stuck with me it stuck by all my brother a well it s part of our makeup controlled chaos another thing the simmons brother had in common with the emanuels they knew how to throw a punch growing up in heroin ridden hollis queen in the 1970s danny and russell once survived a street fight against 12 other guy occasionally they d bring the fighting home one time danny took a comb and ran it through my hair and it hurt real bad say the youngest brother joseph known a rev run i think he wa high their father didn t try to shield his son from all violence he respected what you learned in the culture in the street say russell so he never really hid u from the stuff that wa right on our corner that exposure also created motivation seeing tragedy always push you to move past it say danny the oldest who beat heroin addiction decade ago video by diane tsai for time not all kid from tough neighbor hood make it out but russell is now a multimillionaire entrepreneur a co founder of def jam recording and the

the hip hop trio run d m c in the 1980s and 90 and is now an ordained minister and reality tv star the simmons brother grew up closer to raw systemic violence than most family in this story but even outside hollis some of the family especially those with boy recalled a household dynamic that resembled a fight club with a few notable exception most described a sibling dynamic that wa wildly competitive at best and physically violent at worst they grew up in controlled chaos heavy on conflict light on manner and indifferent to standard of appropriate behavior few recalled major rift between their parent but many of these sibling said they regularly fought with their brother and sister over everything from clothing to board game to who had to sit in the middle seat on long car trip zeke emanuel put it this way if there wasn t blood it wa a good night mealtime debate could get so vicious they horrified outsider joel gay recall that his wife wa on the verge of tear when she first had dinner with his family she said i have never seen anything like that why are you screaming at each other he remembers if you don t under stand haitian culture you can think we re actually fighting the simmons family left courtesy of the simmons family right anthony behar sipa press ap some of the rowdy behavior sound like normal run of the mill mischief roxane and joel gay pushed their baby brother michael down the stair in a laundry basket susan and janet wojcicki loved to trick a young anne into approaching stranger and calling them fat gina rodriguez once put glue in her sister rebecca s milk they committed all the venial sin of american teenager and some of the cardinal one a well across the nine family there were incident of teenage parenthood smoking pot underage drinking cutting school bar fight shoplifting and drag racing at least two had party when their parent weren t home esther wojcicki say she found out about her daughter secret house party only when a student came to school wearing clothes pilfered from her own closet her daughter dispute that particular anecdote for some of these sibling growing up in a constant state of trial by combat made them tougher for others the bad behavior wa a symptom of their willingness to make mistake an anti perfectionism that hardened into resilience it wasn t just that they fought it wa that they fought and then moved on we were called a lot of bad name and we had to withstand that and continue to go on say zeke emanuel that breed a certain kind of toughness and though few openly admit it sibling rivalry can motivate achievement say new york university psychologist ben dattner winning the nobel prize is a more civilized way of beating the crap out of your brother lesson in mortality jack and rachel

nobody in their family cared much about politics and they didn t break rule because there weren t any rule to break instead since their sister s death more than a decade ago the antonoffs say they re motivated by a constant awareness of their own mortality when you hear about a movie coming out that you re excited to see do you not think every time oh i hope i m still alive rachel asks sitting in the los angeles studio where jack is recording his latest album jack nod digging into a cupcake in honor of his 32nd birthday i have to get my gallbladder out and i don t want to do it until this record is done in case i die on the table he say everything back up to the amount of work i do before i die that creates a work ethic there s an urgency the antonoff family left courtesy of the antonoff family right amy lombard posttraumatic growth is a tricky concept for many kid and even adult a loss of this magnitude may cause permanent devastation not motivation and yet while the antonoffs experienced a loss significantly more shattering than most many of the other eight family also experienced a brush with untimely death the woman who wa shot in the head in front of the rodriguezes home wa their cousin the simmons brother saw friend and neighbor killed by drug aid and gang violence rahm emanuel nearly died a a teenager when a deep cut in his finger developed into a bone infection he ended up losing half his finger such experience can fuel ambition after spending week in the hospital battling that life threatening infection rahm say he transformed from a slacker student into a go getter i made sure that given how close i came to dying that i wa never ever going to not get the most out of everything i wa doing he say i wa a changed person it can also help a family get their priority straight jack and rachel s mother shira antonoff said sarah s death drowned out all the petty judgment and expectation of their suburban new jersey community she let her kid skip school she didn t insist they finish college and she took jack to get his lip pierced at age 15 to the shock and dismay of other mother in the grocery store the core wa we ve had a sick kid we ve had a kid who s died so let s get real about what s important here shira say you ve got to find a path in life that you re really happy with a free range childhood like many of the other sibling in this story tan and maya lin grew up on a university campus were raised by immigrant parent and bickered constantly over board game they were also allowed to do practically anything they wanted you could say it wa the opposite of helicopter parenting their father henry huan lin had been forced to take calligraphy class while growing up in china an experience he loathed so much that it informed his parenting philosophy he promised that when he had kid they would never have to do anything they didn t want to do maya say and so the lin parent who fled mao and ultimately became professor at ohio university didn t monitor their child s homework or force them to join sport team or push them to learn the piano we were given all sort of freedom to do whatever we wanted recall tan now a poet and the author of a dozen book maya an artist and architect who designed the vietnam veteran memorial put it this way they were the anti dragon parent the lin family left and right courtesy of the lin family the lin sibling spent most of their time outside or writing poem or throwing clay in the university ceramic studio they went to a high school with an open module system which meant that sometimes they went to class only two day a week i ve only ever chafed when there are rule maya say few of the sibling in this story had parent who closely monitored their movement and many said they were raised with significantly more freedom than their friend by the standard of today s helicopter parent they ran wild the dungey sister rode all over sacramento on their bike alone the antonoffs were allowed to skip school whenever they wanted six year old zeke emanuel regularly escorted 4 year old rahm home from nursery school on a chicago city bus she wa a supporter of u but she didn t tell

five year old susan wa often left to babysit 4 year old janet and infant anne and local mother raised their eyebrow when the girl rode their bike alone to the dime store a mile away but esther ha a theory the more you do for your kid the le they do for themselves and the le empowered they feel she say thousand of extraordinary family flourish across america and the new generation of hyperaware

huge amount of debt in a short period of time set her on a path of financial over achievement since then she ha increased her income each year in 2013 excluding her salary from her full time job which she quit that year she earned 117 000 in 2014 that increased to 164 000 in 2015 her earnings jumped to 321 000 and last year she made just shy of 1 million 979 000 to be exact plus the 27 year old is a digital nomad she and her husband live in an rv chasing 70 degree weather they were in arizona when we spoke in late january and enjoying the view of a slew of national park including colorado

frugal even though i make 100 000 a month i ll still wear my favorite shirt even if it ha a hole in it she say but the biggest reason for her success may be her internal drive i ve always been super competitive she say i would always win at a board game or jump rope the most little thing like that and people would often joke michelle s going to be president one day or michelle s going to be a millionaire one day because i wa always so competitive determined and independent her friend and family also thought she would be successful because she always helped others with their problem growing up i wa always super determined so i don t think anyone wa surprised with how successful my blog wa she say it wa always expected of me that i d do something pretty out of the norm here s how she paid off her debt and grew her income so quickly how did you pay off your student loan so quickly six month before i graduated i received a letter stating how much i would owe every month when i graduated it wa going to be 500 a month or so i don t remember the number but it wa a number i felt wa way too high for my income i decided i didn t want it hanging over my head for the rest of my life so i figured i would try to pay it off a quickly a i could so i didn t have to worry about it 10 year from now i figured a little bit of pain now would be worthwhile later so in addition to being a financial analyst i also did a bunch of side job altogether i wa working 100 hour a week my side job consisted of taking survey mystery shopping doing staff writing doing research phone call for company and other thing a soon a i earned any extra money i put it toward my student loan debt so it wouldn t be sitting in my bank account and i wouldn t be thinking of other way to spend it what were your expense during this time my boyfriend at the time now my husband and i had bought a house when we were 20 and our mortgage wa le than 1 000 but i had other regular expense like transportation grocery etc we also had combined our finance so it helped that we shared our bill when did the blog start coming into the picture i had actually started my blog in august 2011 before i graduated with my finance mba i got the idea one day when i wa reading cosmo and they had an article featuring the personal finance site daily worth i started reading that website and i became super interested in personal finance blog i started my blog a a hobby i didn t start it thinking i d make an income from it six month later i made my first 100 from my blog when a blogger friend who wa already profiting from her blog connected me with an advertiser i didn t even know blog could make money until then my blog had genuinely just been fun for me but once i realized i could make money it boosted my motivation i sought out deal and wanted to see if company wanted to sponsor my blog also company would approach me when my blog had been just a hobby they would approach me but i would ignore all those email once i realized i could make money from my blog i took them more seriously and gave them my rate at that time i charged 100 for a sponsored post on my blog or 150 for an advertisement on my sidebar i also made a little bit on google adsense and affiliate income where i wa promoting other company product and if one of my reader bought through me the company would pay me my advertiser were mainly financial company like coupon website and cell phone apps and other service that helped people save money at that time it wasn t so much bank but i do have bank advertiser now and i charge them much more than that of course i also started looking for opportunity writing for other blogger and immersing myself into the blogging community how much did you earn from the blog to begin with in the beginning in may of 2012 i earned 500 and by december 2012 i wa up to 5 700 that month the month i paid off my student loan july of 2013 i earned 11 000 that month how exactly doe the blog bring in money now i m making money in much different way from just a few year ago before i wa making money from sponsored post and by writing for other blog and now the majority is through affiliate marketing 50 000 a month is from that and that s the bulk of my income there are 15 20 company i actively promote on my social medium and blog platform the other big revenue stream is my affiliate marketing course in which i teach other blogger how to create affiliate income in november 2016 that accounted for 38 000 of my income i created that because i had so many blogger email me asking them to teach them how to increase their affiliate marketing earnings now it s more a form of passive income since i already created the source and people just purchase it and all the instruction and lesson are already done my third biggest source of income from my blog is advertising in those instance maybe i partner with a bank and they ask me to advertise a certain service or product that they are currently selling or i participate in a twitter chat with the company or they do some kind of advertisement on my social medium platform why did your income roughly triple from 2015 to 2016 in 2015 i decided to stop doing all my freelancing i stopped doing virtual assisting and decided to focus entirely on my blogging business i wa nervous to get rid of all my client but i realized i truly loved blogging myself and not blogging for others by focusing on my business i wa finally able to find way to diversify my income improve my blog increase my traffic and come up with extra idea for my blog such a the course which now account for a big chunk of my income 20 30 i also wa able to focus on affiliate marketing and improving my traffic which directly relates to making more money blogging a well it only took me a few month after i dropped all those client to start seeing the jump in my income i wa making 12 000 15 000 monthly when i decided i wa going to focus just on my own business then i made a jump to the 20 000 30 000 range and it just kept going to 40 000 then 50 000 to where i am now at 100 000 how ha your changing income changed your lifestyle a a full time blogger i have a flexible schedule and am my own bos and now travel full time my husband who used to be a new car salesman quit his day job at the same time i quit mine in october 2013 when i wa making 10 000 a month from the blog and now work on the blog too at the time we were making more from our day job put together than from the blog but we knew we could live off our blog if we did it full time the main lifestyle change is that we live in an rv are location independent and work wherever we can we sold our house in missouri in july 2015 and now we work from wherever why did you start living in an rv my husband ha always wanted to live in an rv and he spent a long time convincing me to live in an rv there s always a joke in the rv community that there s always one person who want to do it and then the other person ha to spend year convincing the other person to do it that s pretty much how it wa but i stepped into an rv one day we just decided to look at one and i loved being in it so we decided to give rving a shot it wa just going to be a weekend thing to see family or do short weekend or week trip but we came to love it and never went home we would be gone for a month or two at a time so we just decided to turn the rv thing into a full time venture and haven t looked back since how big wa your house we had a finished basement and so if you count that 2 500 square foot if you don t it wa 1 200 square foot with three bedroom how big is the rv it s 400 square foot if you include all the slide being out did you have to get rid of a lot of stuff yes the salvation army came and took a bunch of stuff and we rented a dumpster to collect broken appliance and junk and we had neighbor come and just take whatever they wanted for free we kept clothing and photo album how doe living in an rv make your finance different from other people s it doesn t really change our rv cost more than our house but rving can be a cheap or expensive a you want it to be just like with a normal home there are cheap rv and there are rv worth million of dollar it s comparable to living in a home but i have a different view all the time there are free place to stay but we mainly choose private campground or state park that cost money we usually stay in one place for a month we like to follow the weather so we like to stay in a forever 70 degree weather area and we like to follow activity we like such a riding our bike outside and going for a hike so 70 degree weather is what we re looking for all year long how ha all this newfound wealth changed you i m not a stressed about money a i wa just a few year ago but i m just a frugal a before it s not below me to use a coupon i just don t like to be wasteful if there s a way to save money i m not going to waste time to find way to save money but if a money saver is there i ll go for it how ha your wealth changed your relationship it really hasn t changed them too much we re often told that people are surprised we re the same and that you would expect people making 100 000 a month to not be a nice or down to earth but many of our friend still call u down to earth how wa money handled when you were growing up and what habit or attitude did you carry into adulthood my mom wasn t super good with money but my dad wa better so i learned what to do from him he taught me how to live within my budget and also how to use a credit card correctly a lot of people think credit card are the root of all evil but you can use them to build your credit score and you can earn reward point with them i m still very frugal i don t pay for any form of tv i don t have cable netflix hulu or anything like that we haven t spent any money on tv since february 2015 to save money and also to not spend a much time watching tv i feel like there s plenty of thing to watch on local channel if i had any more channel i d be in front of the tv all day long how much time do you spend on your blog between 40 and 60 hour a week i work longer hour when i m trying to get far ahead in my blog content i currently do three blog post a week do you have help i do have an editor who edits my site

village of the peloponnese so when george papageorgiou the owner of esti olive oil asked me if i wanted to go to kalamata to see how they harvest the olive and turn them into olive oil i jumped at the chance to me this wa kind of like winning the lottery i wa going to the peloponnese and getting a chance to enjoy some liquid gold being greek i grew up eating olive oil i know others might disagree with me but i will take a good quality olive oil over butter any day i love using it to make popcorn i drizzle it on fresh tomato and slice of bread i use it to fry fish and a an ingredient in cake before there were rule for the amount of liquid you could carrying on a plane my mother and i would bring half gallon container of olive oil back from our trip to greece the best olive oil come from greece i say this with objectivity a a chef and would like to think that this override any bias that my greek heritage hold in greece it is said that the best of greek olive oil come from the peloponnese for year i have wished that greek would be more like the italian the italian do a fantastic job of exporting and promoting their product to other country with the booming introduction of greek yogurt into the u s i m hoping that greek olive oil will soon follow suit george papageorgiou is trying to make that happen the esti olive grove in kalamata is located in a beautiful sunlit valley the grove of mature olive tree look a if they belong in greek mythology the olive must be harvested at a specific time during the ripening process like goldilocks searching amongst the belonging of the three bear george is in constant search for the olive that are just right if the olive are too green the olive oil produced will taste bitter if the olive are too black the quality of the olive oil will be lost it s a constant balancing act a we headed into the olive grove numerous fine mesh net were being laid down to gather and catch all the olive worker set up ladder to reach the tall branch the lower hanging branch were gently being shaken taking care not to wound the tree i began to collect olive in my little basket a my hand turned a reddish brown i reminisced about the day i used to spend a a child collecting olive with my yiayia we took the gathered olive back to the production plant where george had them ground into paste using large millstone this he explained is the traditional method used for making olive oil after grinding the paste then get slowly stirred in a separate container for 20 to 40 minute this is a process known a malaxation with malaxation the slow churning action allows the small droplet of oil that were released in the milling process to aggregate forming large droplet of oil which facilitates mechanical extraction i wa a bit overwhelmed during the whole process i looked around the manufacturing facility much like a child the first time they visit disneyland i snapped picture i wanted to see what wa behind every door i asked george if the oil we had witnessed being made wa virgin or extra virgin i had always assumed that the grading of extra virgin denoted a different process or different stage in the olive s ripeness george shook his head this wa not correct in fact all olive oil produced by physical mechanical mean is virgin the differentiation of extra virgin is the virgin olive oil that satisfies specific high chemical and organoleptic criterion in layman s term it is the virgin olive oil that ha low free acidity and no quality defect the final room we visited that day wa lined with shiny steel tank much like a winery the storage of the olive oil in steel tank help to preserve it and keep it from oxidizing it s the final resting place for the olive oil before it is bottled in greek the word theoxenia come from

foundation that bear his name to settle assorted legal problem earlier he dipped into that same charity box filled by others donation to pay for a larger than life 10 000 painting of himself he lie about 9 11 he lie about charity but on he stride but trump himself present her with an unprecedented conundrum how doe she take on a candidate who lie and lie and lie so where can hillary begin if she call him a liar he ll hit back over her use of a private email server calling her crooked hillary knowing that some 60 of american believe she s dishonest the risk is that he ll use her experience and expertise against her casting her a the boring know it all against the freewheeling entertaining guy who relies on good old gut instinct if that sound familiar that s because it s a show we ve already seen in 2000 al gore wa clearly the more accomplished ready for office candidate but he came across a impatient and pompous against the looser backslapping george w bush never mind that one wa a visionary on the issue of climate change while the other would lead the u into the catastrophic invasion of iraq on the night bush came across better on tv which brings u to a core problem facing hillary clinton poll show there are million of voter especially young one who agree in big number that trump is a racist and a sexist unqualified for america s highest office but who are refusing to back clinton one survey of 18 to 34 year old recorded dire number for trump but still found only 31 supporting clinton with 29 preferring libertarian gary johnson and 15 the green candidate jill stein if those number are replicated on election day trump will win this too stir queasy memory of 2000 in that year a small but significant bloc on the left voted for ralph nader instead of gore more than 90 000 voted for nader in florida a state gore wa eventually deemed to have lost by just 537 vote had even a tiny fraction of those naderites decided to hold their nose and choose gore instead there would have been no bush presidency and no iraq war i know this is a sore and contested point among those who chose nader who to this day blame gore for not doing enough to appeal to the left forgetting perhaps that he also had to appeal to centrist voter in order to win the election but the basic case is surely clear in a two party system like america s if you want to stop trump then a vote for johnson or stein will not do it only a vote for clinton can prevent a white nationalist bigot becoming the next u president you might think this is all so obvious that it barely need stating but 2000 can seem like ancient history to those who don t remember it and here younger voter are not to blame older liberal haven t seared the bush calamity into the mind of the next generation they never turned 2000 into a cautionary tale of the cost of third party indulgence a the new republic put it this week liberal have failed to teach millennials about the horror of george w bush republican meanwhile bang on about the supposedly dismal presidency of jimmy carter to this day just a british conservative invoked the 1979 winter of discontent for over three decade it is the centre left that is oddly reticent about exploiting it opponent history of failure so now even though the hour is late this is the case democrat must make that this is an exceptional election because donald trump represents an exceptional menace to america and to the world it is indeed a referendum on trump and the only way to vote no in that referendum is to vote clinton she may not be the candidate of your dream but she s all that stand between you and an american nightmare you don t have to love her you don t even have to like her you re not saying she s flawless though the current democratic platform is it most progressive in 30 year thanks in part to the challenge of bernie sander a joe biden put it don t compare her to the almighty compare her to the alternative and the alternative is president

have come out about what will presumably be called the iphone 7 bloomberg probably ha the most accurate reporting thus far thanks to it hiring of apple reporter mark gurman in a report that basically confirms what ha leaked out about the iphone over the next few month the big news is that the form factor will remain largely the same there will be a dual lens camera system for the larger iphone and the home button will provide haptic feedback rather than depress like a physical button oh yeah and the headphone jack it s dead dunzo let s all take a moment of silence for the headphone jack not to downplay the new stuff though i have thought on that just wait it s worth noting that this follows my playbook for bulletproof iphone prediction to a tee in case you need a reminder this is what we can always expect from a new iphone it will be apple s fastest iphone ever it will have apple s most advanced optic there will be at least one extra feature you can t get on any other iphone it will come in rose gold and now i guess we can add it won t have a headphone jack still i m sure i m not the only person who look at the leak of the next iphone and say huh ok if we re being honest this probably won t be the most exciting iphone release we ve seen this isn t to say i won t still buy the next iphone i m totally going to buy the new iphone in september but if we re being honest this probably won t be the most exciting iphone release we ve seen personally i think that s ok i m not completely sure how i feel about apple potentially shifting the design upgrade from every two year to every three new color aside that make it really hard to show off that you ve got the latest and greatest phone but now that we re nearly a decade into the modern smartphone era it might not be realistic to expect new design every other year regardless of what other whiz bang goodness apple introduces this year and i m sure there will be at least one feature that will make even the most jaded amongst u salivate the reality is that this will absolutely be the iphone remembered a the one where apple dropped the headphone jack that s it pack it up waterproof casing wireless charging better battery life and more powerful optic could all be thing we see and these would be amazing upgrade old design or not but the real headline is that this is the first iphone without a headphone jack i can say with absolute certainty that every major review of the device is going to focus substantially on this fact and thinking about it i have to wonder is apple making such an enormous and potentially unpopular change this year so that next year s iphone you know the one that might have an all glass display and an ultra sharp amoled screen won t suffer that s the phone that might ditch the home button altogether it s also the phone that will coincidentally be released the same year a the 10th anniversary of the original iphone and apple love to celebrate anniversary a 20th anniversary edition macintosh from 1997 fun fact this wa one of the first product design from jony ive image christie s auction house downplaying the iphone 7 so the next iphone can thrive maybe i m reading too much into the tea leaf but it strike me that apple could be deliberately cutting the headphone jack this year a year that is already going to be le exciting by virtue of no major redesign in order to protect the next iphone from the inevitable backlash over the headphone jack s removal the backlash will be angrier than when apple changed from the 30 pin connector to the lightning port yes yes i ve been telling everyone to accept that the headphone jack is dead since january a frequent point of discussion on our podcast mashtalk ha been about the headphone jack and where all of u are in facing reality even tech editor pete pachal ha come around to see the light the jack is dead and there will be backlash the backlash will be angrier than when apple changed from the 30 pin connector to the lightning port making all of those old dock accessory obsolete and the rallying cry from pundit is already louder than it wa when apple decided to not include a floppy drive on the original imac i feel very certain that backlash aside the ultimate fallout of a headphone jack free iphone will be minimal people will grumble adapter will be annoying and we ll all bitch and moan about how bluetooth just isn t good enough but we ll survive and within a year most of u will be used to using either lightning headphone dongle or snazzy wireless option we ll have moved on which of course mean that the buzz around the 2017 iphone will be all positive new design new screen and some other snazzy feature but that missing headphone jack so last year s problem and that s why the more i think about it the more i feel like the iphone 7 ha to be a little bit boring so that we can get really hyped about the next big iphone and it need to drop the headphone jack now so the 10th anniversary iphone doesn t carry that particular scarlet letter despite the inevitable death of the headphone jack i m still going to buy the iphone 7 but i mostly just want to get this release over

have argued that it s an issue of safety for non transgender student in reality however lesbian gay bisexual and transgender student face the greater risk of harassment and assault especially transgender student and supporter say the bathroom discussion should be focused on protecting their safety according to fbi statistic more than 20 percent of reported hate crime were attack based on

uncomfortable sharing a restroom with a trans student they could opt to use another part of that could be how our community at liberty is really all about family she said we just don t accept that

last month the u s department of education and the u s justice department told school across the country that title ix of a 1972 federal education law protects transgender student from discrimination based on sex including the use of bathroom locker room and showering facility the department reminded school that those that did not comply with title ix requirement risked losing federal fund in a virginia case a federal court agreed with the federal government and sided with a transgender student who challenged his school s policy that force him to a bathroom that doe not match his gender

travel down a rabbit hole of speculation that ha swallowed so many one thing is sure though while donald trump ha thus far appeared to accomplish the impossible even he ha limit the reality is that trump like policymakers and politician past present and future is operating within the confines of the overton window of political possibility the overton window when you think about it it s so true this theory named for the late joseph p overton of the mackinac center for public policy is a way to explain how opinion about public policy shift over time and the constraint within which policymakers operate the overton window is the spectrum of idea that are politically palatable to voter although there is no limit to the number of policy idea available elected official are limited to only actively supporting idea within this window for example consider federal welfare policy even though there are load of idea about how to address poverty in the united state politician support and debate only a select few such a the minimum wage earned income tax credit medicaid etc these are within the overton window other idea such a a guaranteed basic income even though they may be debated in other country and supported by economist on both the left and the right are never seriously considered by politician because they lie outside the window trump s public policy explained with this in mind now consider trump s recent about face after he said the victim of the recent orlando shooting should have been permitted to carry gun into the pulse nightclub about a week after making the statement trump appeared to backtrack and said he meant nightclub employee and guard should have been armed not patron this wasn t just a flip flop or mere pandering it s more likely that trump s movement on the issue is evidence he realized his initial stance wa a step outside the overton window while many of his supporter are no doubt staunch believer in the second amendment even the nra which endorsed him said no one think that people should go into a nightclub drinking and carrying firearm using the overton window theory to your advantage it is important to remember that politician rarely move the window more often than not they only support policy that are deemed acceptable by their constituent when trump said orlando nightclub patron should have been armed the backlash showed him that position wa outside the window so he stepped his stance back to one more acceptable to voter the lesson in all this is that politician a friedrich hayek once wrote are like cork bobbing in the sea they only go where the current lead them and it is u you me and our neighbor who determine the direction of the current in other word if you want to see policy change if you want to expand the

torn out men who merely looked at one of his wife or concubine were punished by death according to the guinness book of world record ismai l fathered 888 child the greatest number of progeny for anyone throughout history that can be verified based on report by dominique busnot a french diplomat who frequently traveled to morocco the sultan may actually have had 1 171 child from four wife and 500 concubine by 1704 at that time ismai l wa 57 and had ruled for 32 year some researcher claimed it wa unlikely ismai l could have fathered that many offspring noting that woman are only fertile for a small window each month that sperm usually do not fertilize egg and that infertility often afflicts woman especially in the developing world however other scientist argued woman are more fertile than those doubting ismai l had said to solve this question scientist developed computer simulation to see how many time ismai l had to have sex each day to have 1 171 child in 32 year they found the

university of vienna told live science the simulation were based on a variety of model of conception for instance one set of simulation assumed the menstrual cycle of woman do not synchronize while another suggested they could other factor included how good ismail s sperm were at fertilizing woman s egg a he aged and how woman often may look more sexually attractive when they are most fertile during their menstrual cycle the simulation suggest ismai l needed to have sex an average of 0 83 to 1 43 time per day in order to father 1 171 child in 32 year moreover the sultan did not need a harem of four wife and 500 concubine to sire that many offspring the researcher suggest he needed a harem of only 65 to 110 woman although the model of conception the researcher employed ultimately all found that ismai l could have actually had all these child the result from them were all quite different from each other oberzaucher said this really emphasizes to u how important it is to choose

jenkins can take 500 variety of herb and marry them with cannabis to treat whatever ail you if you love pot and natural medicine she s someone you want to know unfortunately despite the abundance of healing dr jenkins give back to the world she went through great loss to get where she is today my oldest daughter kiona wa diagnosed with two different type of brain tumor in 2002 when she wa eight year old and i questioned whether chemotherapy and radiation wa the right course of action for treatment for her explains dr jenkins i wa informed that the state of california know what s better for my daughter than i do and that if i did anything different than conventional treatment then i d be acting outside of medical advice and that i would be a threat to her unfortunately i wa forced to accept but while she wa going through chemotherapy and radiation i started researching and studying for my doctorate and figuring out other holistic alternative kiona passed away in january 2006 12 day shy of her twelfth birthday dr jenkins now practice in her honor going back to her root and using ancestral healing technique my family is from the mississippi band of choctaw indian so we have native american lineage and my grandfather is a native healer she explains i just went back to my native root and just researched along with her work a a healer dr jenkins strives to create room for minority in the cannabis industry that is too often dominated by white men due to financial advantage and their inherent privilege there s a privilege that is associated with being a white male in this country you don t have that same type of fear that other minority group or other people do and you re more in a position to take a risk in jumping into this industry explains dr jenkins who ha also been a part of the minority business council for three year her advice to woman and other minority looking to break through be fearless and strong in your conviction know what you stand for and know what you are trying to accomplish and don t let anything get in your way surround yourself with other like minded people who can be your support system and your tribe and then educate yourself because education is going to be what s going to help you persevere because people are going to challenge you all the time but if you can come back with those challenge with hard evidence and experience and really speak to the level of professionalism that this industry is going to command you ll be taken seriously 2 rachel k gillette attorney an unfortunate aspect of the cannabis industry is that due to lingering federal law and constantly evolving local one if you work with weed you ll likely need a lawyer at some point that s where rachel gillette come in an attorney who ha been working with the regulated cannabis industry since 2010 her area of practice include corporate licensing compliance tax law for marijuana business and pretty much anything related to the operation of cannabis business regulated by the state of colorado i ve always been an advocate for the legalization of marijuana say gillette so in 2010 when i saw the state of colorado wa going to be regulating being the first state in the nation to do so i decided to quit my job and to start my own practice which focused on the representation of these newly formed business enterprise at the time gillette wa taking a major risk since few larger firm were ready to take on cannabis client however gillette s instinct and boldness paid off and she staked her claim in what is now a booming industry gillette say her favorite part the job is that marijuana law is constantly evolving we re doing something that ha never been done before so there s a lot of opportunity to blaze the trail so to speak no pun intended she explains not to mention working to help victim of america s war on drug we ve had 40 year of a failed drug war our father our brother our child are incarcerated at alarming rate unfortunately for minority population and disproportional rate for minority population and a woman we shouldn t stand for that anymore 3 lynne lyman california state director for the drug policy

director of the non profit organization drug policy alliance the leading organization advancing drug policy grounded in science compassion health and human right we always say november 8th wasn t the end it wa the beginning she explains that s true with most law often policymakers forget to think about the implementation piece and sometimes that s the most important piece because if you pas a law and it doesn t get implemented then it s a if it didn t pas along with working to fund cannabis research lyman s biggest passion is making marijuana and marijuana advocacy community more inclusive especially by creating space for those were were a vital part of the weed industry before it wa sanctioned by mainstream society you re walking in today to this whole nice legal world where everybody can wear a name tag that say they re with some cannabis association whereas five year ago even people were still doing federal time for having a dispensary lyman explains the advice i give to all of the people who come into the cannabis industry is understand the history there s the sense that people are just waltzing in a if it s just any other industry i want to discourage that and remind that a lot of people have died people have been incarcerated they ve had their family destroyed making sure you re a good neighbor and you re working with the community that you are based in lyman say that while we see often see white men a the face of legal weed business that doesn t mean they re the one who laid the groundwork for legalization in the first place one thing that ha been true historically in the cannabis movement is that it s been men s face at the forefront and yet it s been a lot of woman doing the behind the scene work explains lyman i m in room after room saying it cannot be all white men in the industry you have to find a way to expand and let other people in that s a policy priority for dpa 4 charlo greene founder of alaska cannabis club you may remember

summit series i use my connection to pull in a many community leader of color to come in and share their knowledge experience and expertise with people that really need a leg up in this industry and make it mean something for them and their community say greene i think a lot of the work that i m doing is overlooked because i am a woman and because i am a person of color greene s success ha come with a heavy price that prof the war on drug in far from over i m facing 54 year for creating the alaska cannabis club so in the meantime it s dreary that my life could be over this year she explains but if i stop doing what i know i am here to do which is share these amazing story and activate people then the state ha already won greene add that she didn t quit her job a a reporter because she

reactor is a region of natural uranium within the earth s crust found in okla gabon uranium is naturally radioactive and the condition in this rocky area happened to be just right to cook up some nuclear reaction the natural reactor must have annoyed nuclear scientist the first nuclear reactor to produce electricity started up in 1951 and this only produced a trivial amount of energy the pile of rock in the ground in okla on the other hand created nuclear power around 2 billion year ago it wa discovered in 1972 when some french scientist took uranium ore from the mine in gabon to test it uranium content typically uranium ore is made up of three type isotope of uranium each one with a different number of neutron uranium 238 which is the most abundant uranium 234 which is the rarest and uranium 235 which nuclear scientist are most interested in because it can sustain nuclear chain reaction one would expect to find that the uranium ore is composed of 0 720 uranium 235 since that is the percentage found in other rock sample from the earth s crust the moon and even meteorite however these french scientist found something fishy the uranium sample only contained 0 717 of uranium 235 what might seem to be a minor discrepancy of 0 003 is very significant with regard to uranium that meant that back at the mine around 200 kilogram around 440 pound of uranium 235 appeared to be missing it hadn t been lost or stolen instead this missing 0 003 had undergone nuclear fission and split into other atom this conclusion may very well have furrowed some brow since there are three very specific condition that a reactor need to churn out energy continuously and a even scientist had struggled to create a nuclear reactor it seemed unlikely that nature just happened to create one purely by accident unlikely but not impossible because that is exactly what happened the condition that the natural reactor happened to fulfill are a follows the first wa owning a good percentage of uranium 235 to fuel the reaction while 0 720 might seem small it s perfect for nuclear fission and when the ore sample from okla are compared to other sample from all over the world it is likely that this wa the percentage over 2 billion year ago when the reactor started the second condition is a source of neutron uranium 235 decay naturally into thorium and release a neutron in the process this neutron can then whoosh towards another uranium 235 atom and start the fission process nuclear fission is when an atom break apart into smaller atom usually releasing energy in the process this neutron fuse with a uranium 235 and together they combine to form uranium 236 which is unstable the uranium 236 is then overwhelmed with instability and split creating a variety of smaller stable atom and some neutron these neutron can then happily shoot towards other atom and continue the chain reaction the nuclear reactor had a supply of a regulating substance a well a flow of natural groundwater a the atom started to split they released neutron a well a energy the water would slow down the neutron but the energy would heat up the water after a time the water would get so hot that it would start to boil off eventually enough of the water would have boiled away until there wasn t enough left in the reactor to slow down the neutron the neutron started shooting off into the ground without reacting with anything and the reaction would stop then the natural flow of groundwater would trickle in until there wa enough water to start the whole process again this watery cycle probably continued for hundred of thousand of year sadly all good day are numbered even for a happy natural reactor the level of uranium 235 got used up and the level wa too low to sustain any more meaningful

pretty much the same a today most of the building are similar people s clothes on the whole aren t all that different give or take a few shoulder pad one thing stand out all of the car look super boxy especially compared with the curving rounded exterior of virtually every car on the market today this underappreciated transformation is probably the most distinct design change to come to car over the past half century and for most u car it happened within just a few year starting in 1986 you can even pinpoint the exact year curve arrived for some model like the buick lesabre which had much harder edge along it hood roof and trunk in 1991 left than 1992 right in the decade since car have just gotten curvier and curvier why the big shift it turn out it wa largely due to three interrelated factor european style trend a government mandated push for fuel economy and new technology that allowed manufacturer to more easily design and create curved shape it all started with european luxury design by the 1980s making curved car wasn t an entirely novel idea it had just largely gone out of fashion among u automaker the streamliner of the 1930s such a the chrysler airflow had a sleek look designed to minimize wind resistance but the airflow and other streamlined american model were commercial failure outsold by bigger boxier car through the 1970s almost every american made car had hard sharp edge with few curve they were uniformly designed a a series of three connected box the hood the cabin and the trunk in europe though fuel wa always more expensive and designer especially in germany explored aerodynamic design much earlier on say penny sparke author of a century of car design in the 1960s and 70 luxury automaker like porsche bmw audi and mercedes benz were some of the first to reintroduce curved exterior one of the earliest most well known example is the porsche 911 which wa pretty curvy way back when it wa introduced in 1963 this aesthetic eventually became associated with these luxury car both in europe and in the u where they arrived a import and inevitably writes historian david gartman in auto opium a social history of american automobile design american automaker began to copy the european aerodynamic aesthetic in the mid 1980s a a way of courting upscale consumer ford more than any other company wa responsible for bringing this design change to the mass market designer uwe bahnsen did it first in europe with the 1982 ford sierra which wa far more curved than similar car of it era reviewer panned the look nicknaming it the jelly mould and the car did not sell well at first over time though buyer got used it especially a other manufacturer eventually copied the style for their own car in the u ford designer jack telnack who d worked on the company s european design team before taking over north american design in 1980 wa most directly responsible for the shift to curve his 1983 ford thunderbird design wa heavily shaped by wind tunnel testing prioritizing aerodynamic line the look soon filtered down to the mass market with the 1986 taurus it might look unremarkable today but the design wa positively futuristic at the time the car wa even used in the movie robocop which wa supposed to take place in the near future the taurus writes gartman wa definitely aiming at the upscale market of young well educated buyer to whom the bmw appealed the strategy worked the taurus wa a huge hit with massive sale that saved the struggling company and inspired a wave of copycat american car automaker had to improve fuel economy part of the reason the curvy look proliferated so quickly and is still with u today is basic physic curved exterior and more steeply pitched windshield make for le wind resistance a air can flow more easily over them this mean le gas ha to be burned to move the car the same distance at the same speed right a the taurus premiered automaker were dealing with corporate average fuel economy standard for the first time starting in 1978 the average fuel economy of each manufacturer s passenger car fleet sold in the u had to reach higher and higher level before plateauing in 1990 at 27 5 mile per gallon while automaker had already achieved some gain in efficiency with improved engine and other component the new curved aesthetic made it much easier and cheaper to achieve further improvement one ford designer claimed that while it would cost 200 to 300 million to achieve a one tenth mile per gallon increase by engineering under the hood aero design achieved a three to four tenth m p g increase for almost nothing gartman writes automaker began relying more heavily on wind tunnel and aerodynamic calculation when designing their car and engineer started working more closely with designer within just a few year virtually every car on the market suddenly looked like the once futuristic taurus they all looked the same because they were all being shaped in the wind tunnel and were designed for fuel economy say larry edsall the author of several book on car design history technology made it easier to produce curve a few key technological development made these design possible and have since allowed automaker to make their car curvier and curvier for decade designer had made car model using clay wood or other physical material during the 1980s they began using computer model it s much easier to make these sort of shape with computer drawing rather than wood sparke say they gave automaker the mean to produce those very soft curve manufacturing technology also made it easier and cheaper to produce curved shape in aluminum than before a a result since that initial shift in the 1990s exterior have only become curvier you can get a good sense of how profound the change ha been by looking at a newer car thought to be remarkably boxy the scion xb sure it ha a big blocky hatchback but it edge are still way more rounded than the truly boxy car of the

d still be making about the same a bit more than 22 per hour fast forward to 2015 though and the picture look a lot different the average man working a typical full time job 35 to 49 hour a week now earns about 26 an hour but the man working 50 hour a week or more now earns close to 33 an hour hourly pay ha risen more than twice a fast over the past three decade for men working long hour a

make up a bit more than half the full time workforce but they account for more than 70 percent of those working 50 hour a week or more so a wage gain have gone disproportionately to people working

and diprete s essay serf a the introduction to a remarkable new collection of paper from the russell sage foundation that examines the progress that woman have and haven t made over the past half century it isn t a simple story the u s ha already made major albeit incomplete progress on many of the most obvious cause of gender inequality explicit discrimination on pay overt barrier to employment taboo against working while raising child what is left is a tangle of cultural norm implicit bias individual preference and other subtler form of discrimination that are much harder to change or even to measure take the long hour anecdote i described above the rapid rise in pay for people working long hour ha played a major role in the persistence of the overall gender wage gap particularly for parent new research in the russell sage foundation volume estimate that the wage gap between mother and father would be 15 percent smaller if the extra hour increase hadn t occurred but that premium itself isn t the result of discrimination explicit or implicit woman who work long hour have seen even faster gain than men although they still earn le on average rather the trend contributes to the wage gap because men are so much more likely than woman to work those long hour that in turn is the result of a confluence of factor that are deeply embedded in the american economy and society woman on average spend much more time than men on housework while men especially a certain category of highly educated elite men are expected to work a much a possible and of course most importantly mother are still far more likely than father to be the primary caregiver for their child government policy could make a difference affordable child care for example could make it easier for woman who want to work long hour to do so but they can only go so far the russell sage foundation paper are full of such thorny issue a rising share of the gender wage gap is driven by pre market factor such a choice of industry and occupation those issue can also be the result of explicit or implicit discrimination but are much harder to address than wage differential within a given job and even force that should help close the gap such a education have proved insufficient woman have for decade been more likely to attend college than men there are now for the first time more female than male college graduate yet the pay gap is widest among the most educated worker girl now outperform boy in many science and math subject in high school but woman are still much le likely than men to work in many of the most lucrative technical field woman have actually lost ground to men in computer science in recent decade and the overall rate of occupational desegregation woman entering traditionally male dominated field and vice versa ha slowed there are some encouraging sign for woman those who do go into science and technology field earn nearly a much a equally experienced men though that isn t true in computer science suggesting the overall wage gap would narrow if more woman entered so called stem field moreover the motherhood penalty the relative decline in wage for woman when they have child ha disappeared or even reversed for highly paid highly educated woman perhaps because they are the most likely to have access to and be able to afford child care that suggests that making child care more widely available could help narrow the gender pay gap for le educated woman too something that is looking more likely now that both major presidential candidate

abortion a a method of family planning in other nation this particularly worry woman s right campaigner in developing country where fund or facility are already limited although this policy doe not directly affect service in the u mr trump ha said he support an abortion ban at home his signing of this order a one of his first executive action indicates he still see the issue a a priority is president trump the first to introduce a ban on foreign funding republican and democrat have been involved in a political tug of war over the issue for decade republican president ronald reagan first created the mexico city policy in 1984 stopping funding for international group which perform or provide information on abortion but democrat later rescinded it under the clinton administration it wa reinstated when president george w bush took over in 2001 and overturned again by president barack obama in 2009 and now it is back what ha all this got to do with mexico city the order s official name is the mexico city policy because president reagan first implemented it at a united nation population conference in mexico city and why is it sometimes nicknamed the global gag law critic of the policy say organisation working around the world feel censored by it because they cannot offer woman full advice on family planning if they flout the rule they lose funding which in some case could

abortion today although he say he would allow exception such a in the case of rape or incest on the presidential campaign trail he said he believed some form of punishment should be in place for woman who have abortion if the practice is banned but after strong criticism he released a statement saying that only the doctor or practitioner should be punished not the woman in an interview with cbs

bluffing he did not have to take a shit so he got back in the car and we drove for another 30 minute and then he announced for a second time that he had to go poop you re not lying this time are you i asked him if you re lying i ll never stop for you to poop again but he said he had really had to go so i pull over and it s the same thing he wa either lying or he got stage fright in the mcdonald s can so my wife put him back in the car and we get stuck in traffic on the beltway just a we re getting home i think you know where this is going once again the boy screamed out that he had to poop i told him he could hold it until we got home then he started clutching at his tummy and cry out to pull over i don t think he s lying this time my wife said but i swear to you we were just a mile from home at that point and the beltway is one of those horrible road that offer very little in the way of ideal place to pull over home wa the only logical destination for him to go void his bowel so i told him he had to hold on jussssst a minute longer begged him really sponsored on the exit ramp he suddenly stopped cry and i knew why i could hear him exhaling forcefully kid don t hide that sort of thing we pulled into the driveway not before hitting every light on the way there and my wife rushed the boy into the house and into the bathroom green shit wa caked on his leg it wa everywhere some of it fell out of his pant how and landed on the front stoop it wa terrifying anyway that s parenting in a nutshell for you you take every precaution possible and you still end up with green shit all over the place now your letter dan i don t know if this is a good question because i doubt there s any kind of satisfying answer to it but why do no nfl team seem to care that jameis winston maybe raped a girl the mock draft all have him going at no 1 or 2 most say no 1 how the fuck especially in light of the year the nfl ha just had and goodell s publicity push for an end to violence towards woman would it be that crazy to suggest that nfl team won t want to risk spending their first round pick on someone who many people believe ha a capacity for actual evil even if he never raped anyone he ha shown he s a liability at best with the crab leg thing and the fuck her right in the pussy thing how are bucky brook and daniel jeremiah not even hedging their bet at this stage i m sure last year they talked ad fucking nauseum about johnny manziel s partying and how that would affect his draft stock how doe rape not why aren t they even mentioning it i think you re wildly overgeneralizing to say team don t care of course they care you d care if you were the gm who decided to risk his job by investing the no 1 pick in a seafood thief and alleged rapist but the bucs desperately need a qb or else everyone get fired anyway so they re probably best off drafting winston and then throwing out a bunch of some bullshit spiel to peter king about how they had private eye talk to over 75 people about winston in studying him for the draft that strike me a an obvious as covering move so they can draft winston and then if he fuck up they can be like don t blame u we talked to 75 whole people about him they just want to make sure he doesn t commit any future rape and if he doe they want to make sure that they can blame winston and winston alone for it but it is strange that in the public scouting process winston s past ha been reduced to a handful of convenient euphemism like immaturity and shit like that look at lovie smith gush about winston even though he can t possibly know him all that well to me i think he s told u an awful lot with how he s handled it smith said it s not like he s getting ready to go into the nfl and scrutiny is coming his way he s gone through it a couple year now and he s answered the bell that s what you have to do you have to have tunnel vision and do your job looking from the outside that s what he s been able to do i mean that s a hell of a way to twist a rape allegation into a positive look at him shake off defender and circuit court judge with such ease the fact that winston wa never formally charged with rape and the fact that the nfl and their broadcast partner probably have a great many lawyer who would prefer that the word rape not be thrown around when addressing winston is all smith need to sell you on the idea of drafting him to concoct a narrative of an ambitious young man looking to redeem himself a a way of cleverly masking the fact that the bucs have an urgent raw football need to fill and they have little choice but to fill it with a guy who might be the scum of the fucking earth that s why winston s rape allegation haven t necessarily affected his draft stock the way johnny manziel s drinking did it s because nfl team think that winston is simply a better player if neither player had baggage going into the draft winston would be taken before manziel every time that s the reason the brown are ready to give up on manziel already it s not the boozing it s the fact that they don t think the little fucker can play the nfl can chirp all they like about domestic violence and doing the right thing but the bottom line is that the majority of their employee must win in order to keep their job and that mean they must place a bloodless premium on talent than the nfl would rather not acknowledge a still existing they constantly want to sell you on character or on potential character instead if jameis is gonna go no 1 no matter what the nfl ha no choice but to hold their nose and make it look like they didn t willingly crown a psychopath prince of the draft you know what s funny about all this winston wa awful last season and i m not talking about just his yakety sax play in the rose bowl he threw 18 pick last season against horrible piddly shit acc team but scout for some reason seem to be far more impressed by the fact that winston staged a number of winning comeback that were necessitated almost exclusively because of his own boneheaded mistake if you look the part and you ve got the arm and you have that subjective mix of football iq and magical qb unicorn leadership skill scout will happily overlook all those turnover and the rape stuff it s quite something by the way superfuck jaw and mike mayock for their little mariota s on top of my board now spiel this week jaw is an empty headed attention whore who will say basically anything and the only reason certain football fan enjoy mayock is because they haven t learned to be sick of him yet kyle are big egg and big nutrition teaming up to push the egg white agenda you have to have roughly double the egg white to get the same amount of food thus causing an increase in egg consumption i m suspicious of the whole thing but the yolk ha all the cholesterol if you simply throw out the yolk and then add bacon ham and cheese to your omelet it can t hurt you at all that s science i used to be huge on egg white true story in college i would go to the dining hall toast a bagel grab a couple of hard boiled egg remove the yolk and then mush the white onto the bagel and eat a sad egg white bagel sandwich that way i thought this wa a healthy lunch conveniently ignoring the whole eating a whole bagel part of the enterprise sometimes i ate two in one sitting do not do this the truth is that egg white are one of those food you eat so that you can eat more food i hate small portion so if i eat a 12 pound egg white omelet i feel like i just got away with something but in general this is untrue you need portion control in your life which mean you should just splurge and eat the goddamn yolk anyway the yolk is the best part all golden and runny and seeping into the toast nook i could a 50 egg omelet i swear there are never enough egg in the omelet for me why are egg so small i need egg to be triple their current size i don t like cracking so many of them i am not a crackpot danny if tomorrow you

that s too much product even the nuttiest white girl beyonce fan would get sick of her if she put out 120 song a year you can t keep up with that kind of catalog those song can t all be great even if they were you d still grade them on a curve and have certain hit in your mind that would make your permanent rotation with everything else falling by the wayside that s easy to do now back in day when i had to listen to tape i usually listened to all the song on the album because i wa too lazy to fast forward i heard back off bitch by gnr far more time than anyone should have to endure not their

favorite artist put out a double album it s a complete pain in the as i need you to go away for a while so that i can grow to love you again whenever an artist say that they had 60 track to choose from or whatever for a single album i can promise you that you never want to hear the 50 track they threw away half of those track are just the guy freestyling on the bongo while high on acid kevin so i m getting married in a month and my fiance and i are closing on a house next week instead of some over the top bachelor party i am asking that my friend just help me move my friend feel that this is selfish and i m taking advantage of them we re moving from a 1 000 square foot apartment into a three bedroom house it s not like we have a ton of stuff the plan wa that i rent the truck and we move everything saturday morning and then grill steak and get drunk saturday night in the new house i think that this is way better than asking everyone to kick in hundred of dollar to go golfing for a weekend or whatever it s my bachelor party and i should be able to do what i want right but that s not a party you re asking for free manual labor instead that doesn t count a a celebration you monster if i threw a party and everyone came and then i wa like hey guy this is a laundry folding party now fold my laundry and i ll get takeout all my friend would have me killed you can t do that if you want to ask your friend to help you move that s fine but you can t apply that to your party credit do the move yourself and then have the bachelor party cookout afterward without putting any work obligation on your friend steve this actually happened close to six year ago but it remains a contentious issue amongst our group of friend five of u were on a road trip from montreal to boston rotating driver evenly a one doe on longish road trip a we got close to boston the friend driving the last leg got pulled over for speeding since we were in college at the time the 200 ticket wa nothing to sneeze at who are we kidding it s still a lot of damn money the issue wa doe the ticket get split amongst the group or paid solely by the driver the four of u who drove first say no since we drove our portion without incident the friend who got slapped with the bill argues that since the last leg wa the toughest and we were trying to get to our destination by a certain time and nobody complained about his speed until the blue and white started flashing that we should split the ticket who is right the last leg wa the toughest why were there dragon lining the highway your friend wa driving and thus he s responsible for his own driving behavior even if he had shit luck he pay the ticket if another friend riding in the car want to pitch in fine but that guy shouldn t expect it these kid today never want to take responsibility smdh i went to a basketball game last week and i had an uber take me home only the uber guy got a parking ticket outside the arena while he wa waiting for me and i felt bad that he got the ticket so when the ride ended i gave him 20 in cash extra and that of course made me feel all generous and kind yes america i helped pay a full one tenth of that poor bastard s ticket while exploiting regulation loophole that force working class people to act a private chauffeur to uppity white dipshits with smartphones medal of honor for me pleeeeeeez but screw your friend tom where would the most opportune time place for alien to land to get the biggest initial audience but not get shot out of the sky the white house lawn would be a great spot but

now that i think about it let s choose any large park space in any other city because central park is a complete fucking pain in the as it s hot and overcrowded and there s horseshit everywhere if alien landed there four million people would converge on the spot and then i wouldn t be able to get a good view and the subway would be jammed and i would just say fuck it and then go home and watch the alien on tv instead mike how doe robocop poop he ha that weird baby food he ha to eat to keep his organic part alive so he must have to release it somehow actually if you look at the original uniform design the posterior covering is soft and potentially removable it s not welded metal robocop could in theory remove a posterior assflap to do his business even if no standard toilet could possibly bear the weight of a three ton cyborg sitting down to shit in it my guess is that instead of straight defecation robocop ha an internal waste management system that process his urine and

the medium blow that up for what would his twitter handle be would he put a picture and bio or just keep the egg there like a weirdo there are call for obama s impeachment and resignation on a daily basis right now so i assume a luther account would only amplify those daily complaint more like marco boob io amirite that tweet would probably help fill up a news cycle or two before everyone stopped giving a shit i don t think he d actually resign though after all plenty of politician out there already use twitter for trolling purpose and we live in age where you can survive pretty much any scandal so long a you re willing to sit there and ride it out you let 200 million people take a dump on your face for a week nod politely and then everything is back to normal i do think he d have a picture and bio for his troll account tho the obama machine know too much about the internet to let that slide email of the week ape chemist suppose during the first round of the nfl draft the camera cut to a player talking on his cell phone and smiling and celebrating with his family and friend this all take place while the team is on the clock so goodell ha yet to announce the pick while celebrating the player like lamarr houston or bill gramatica tear his acl assume the team hasn t officially announced the pick doe the nfl let the team withdraw the pick i remember when the viking had to pas on a pick because they didn t get their card in on time so i could absolutely see some team arguing the pick wasn t official until the card is turned in and read i hope this happens to some team like the cowboy and jerry sends someone onstage to tackle goodell before he reach the podium i might be wrong but i think once you turn the card in the pick is final no backsies even if it hasn t been formally announced if you haven t turned the card in but glory boy decided to tear his knee up anyway then fuck him switch it and draft todd gurley instead but once the ginger hammer ha that card

the chatbot replacing teaching assistant or professor he expects the chatbot s question answering ability to be an invaluable asset for massive online open course where student often drop out and generally don t receive the chance to engage with a human instructor with more human like interaction goel expects online learning could become more appealing to student and lead to better educational outcome to me this is a grand challenge goel said education is such a huge priority for the entire human race at the start of this semester goel provided his student with a list of nine teaching assistant including jill the automated question and answering service goel developed with the help of some of his student and ibm goel and his teaching assistant receive more than 10 000 question a semester from student on the course s online forum sometimes the same question are asked again and again last spring he began to wonder if he could automate the burden of answering so many repetitive question a goel looked for a technology that could help he settled on ibm watson which he had used for several other project watson an artificial intelligence system wa designed to answer question so it seemed like a strong fit to train the system to answer question correctly goel fed it forum post from the class s previous semester this gave jill an extensive background in common question and how they should be answered goel tested the system privately for month having his teaching assistant examine whether jill s answer were correct initially the system struggled with similar question such a where can i find assignment two and when is assignment two due goel tweaked the software adding more layer of decision making to it eventually jill reached the point where it answer were good enough i cannot create chaos in my classroom jill had to be almost perfect a a human ta or i am goel said the system is only allowed to answer question if it calculates that it is 97 percent or more confident in it answer goel found that wa the threshold at which he could guarantee the system wa accurate there are many question jill can t handle those question were reserved for human teaching assistant goel plan to use jill again in a class this fall but will likely change it name so student have the challenge of guessing which teaching assistant isn t human", "question": "what happened when a

another bush dirty trick the marco robotos were animated by operative from democratic super pac american bridge kevin mcallister the pac s deputy communication director turned costumed robot said the

bob durant a rhode island lawyer who wa political touring with his family and friend you wonder is it really because you have so many people that thing are delayed bob asked or is it because after the debate he ha to re write his entire speech since chris christie ripped it up his wife meg wa watching it all with more of an insider s eye the michigan state director for the bush quayle 1992 campaign meg durant look for the little thing to tell her how a campaign is doing after saturday s republican debate she grabbed a couple of christie and bush sign for her kid some christie volunteer followed her all the way back to her car they waited for me to drive away to make sure she didn t replace one of their christie sign with a bush sign christie s people they are street fighter still she admitted it s been difficult to predict how thing are going i thought jeb had it i thought he wa a shoo in when the race first got underway after bush began to founder i thought marco would have walked away with it but after last night she gave a little shrug i hope this morning is the marco we want to see durant wa also finding it difficult to figure how event turnout especially with the rising interest in political tourism translates into vote there are ten of u here she noted and only one of u is a new hampshire voter that would be her cousin tom stevens a retired lawyer who moved from ohio to new hampshire two year ago he s still undecided his wife wa for hillary clinton until she went to a clinton rally last week now she s undecided too when rubio finally showed up a little after ten he wa a flat a well a pancake a couple of housekeeping item were the first word out of his mouth we couldn t figure out how to make pancake for 800 people i hope they fed you it didn t get better he s still going to abolish the federal department of education but he s decided to offer tom brady a cabinet position belichick too and then because at best he can only really modify and not stop himself well i m going to say it again barack obama is the first president at least in my lifetime that want to change the country not fix it problem he want to make it a different kind of country thing perked up a little bit when rubio agreed to answer a few question calling on innocuous looking white haired fellow in a bright flannel shirt identifying himself a capt dan a 65 year old retired charter boat operator and a rubio constituent from florida he wondered what a president rubio would do about the climate change flooding that s putting his house in miami beach underwater i m going to get my money out of it and move to higher ground capt dan explained who added that he doesn t expect to live forever isn t there something rubio can do about climate change for the young people rubio ha a script for this question climate change legislation hurt the economy it hurt the economy and ha no real impact on the environment the better approach is to support innovator of american energy i say ok if we pas this bill how many foot of sea rise will it prevent he explained reasonably a he ha on this and many other occasion well it won t prevent any sea rise ok well how many degree of temperature will it avoid going up well it won t do that either but afterwards capt dan professed to be happy with rubio s response last time i heard him say it which just happened to be in manchester two day ago he said it wa too expensive too difficult wait this time he started to look to the side a little bit see a different way to see it possibly so reframing climate change a a family issue not an environmental one could certainly cause rubio some cognitive dissonance very possibly that could be the conscious intent of folksy capt dan who traveled all the way to new hampshire because this is such an intimate state where i have access to all the candidate where i can ask the question i want to ask folksy capt dan kipnis who traveled all the way to new hampshire on

at 3 p m which wa passed into law by congress in 2000 observation of the moment is left up to participating organization such a amtrak and major league baseball and a in the u k and canada the veteran

distributed in the u s population 316 million this year by comparison 45 million poppy will be distributed in the u k population 64 million for armistice day according to the royal british legion why doesn t the united state have a common culture of commemoration one potential explanation lie in the fact that the u s hasn t recently experienced the kind of generational destruction that say the first and second world war brought to britain and russia respectively britain lost approximately 2 percent of it population in the great war resulting in a lost generation jay winter of yale university told me that those men left behind a void an absence a black hole in the center of thousand of family defined in part by who wasn t there the soviet union suffered an even more dramatic loss in the second world war amounting to roughly 15 percent of it population by comparison u s loss in the second world war constituted about 0 3 percent of the population and 0 1 percent in the first world war the only american war that incurred such steep loss wa the civil war in which 2 percent of the population perished it should come a no surprise then that the trauma of that conflict led to the establishment of decoration day the precursor of memorial day difference in how military holiday are observed can t be reduced to a number game though in the united state at least they may also stem from a strain of american thinking that highlight historical triumph and skip over what those triumph have cost lindsey tepe of the new america foundation for instance ha written about the way in which public education ha become a battleground between those who view american history a a sweeping tale filled with grand hero epic battle and the continuing struggle for the right to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness and those who recognize that american history is also full of inconvenient truth and the injustice perpetrated throughout the course of building this nation winter argues that what make u s commemoration different is the emphasis on redemption in american narrative of war in the u k on the other hand the absence of the lost generation mattered more when america s national mythology and political discourse preach a tale of endless victory and exceptionalism there is le of an incentive to focus on those men and woman who didn t come home from battle what make u s commemoration different is the emphasis on redemption in it narrative of war the finer detail make a difference a well joe davis director of public affair at the vfw belief the all volunteer force established in 1973 drove a wedge between the military community and an ever growing civilian population during the second world war the united state fielded a conscription based military of approximately 16 million people out of a population of 135 million today the professional military is well below it troop level during world war ii and the u s population ha more than doubled in the interim davis also cited a a factor the shifting of memorial day from it original fixed date of may 30 to the last monday of may when you link a military holiday to a three day weekend you lose the meaning of the day davis told me whatever the explanation the lack of an appropriate occasion to commemorate america s war casualty ha been noted from 1989 until his passing in 2012 senator daniel inouye of hawaii a world war ii veteran repeatedly introduced resolution to return memorial day to it traditional date and by proxy it original intent separately two bill have been introduced in

the labor department other american company say they have analyzed pay this way though most do it privately marc benioff the c e o of salesforce com said last year that after such an analysis the company spent 3 million to make woman s salary equal to men s kimberly clark and pricewaterhousecoopers have said their examination led manager to address the fact that fewer woman were reaching top position to negotiate or not men are paid more partly because they re much more likely to ask for it when receiving job offer 51 5 percent of men and 12 5 percent of woman asked for more money according to a study of carnegie mellon university graduate student by linda babcock an economist at the university in other research she found that when woman did ask they asked for 30 percent le than men requested because starting salary determine raise and future salary woman who do not bargain lose a much a 750 000 for middle income job and 2 million for high income job over their career m babcock found but her research and that of others ha found that woman are penalized for negotiating while men are rewarded for the same behavior a the actress jennifer lawrence wrote in lenny after the sony hacking revealed that she wa paid le than her male co star she didn t fight for more because i didn t want to seem difficult or spoiled one solution m babcock said is to coach woman to negotiate another is to change corporate practice so the people who set compensation are aware of the disparity and are advocate for woman during negotiation another answer is to ban pay negotiation completely that is what ellen pao did when she wa chief executive of reddit the company established pay range based on role and experience and gave applicant nonnegotiable offer we put the onus on the company to pay fairly instead of on candidate to negotiate fair pay m pao wrote in the hollywood reporter don t rely on previous salary if woman can lose million over their career because they get job offer based on pay that is already low one way to stop the pattern is to ignore their past salary google ha said it doe this and instead make offer based on what a job is worth in august the federal

practice particularly disadvantaged woman who had taken time off to raise child woman are also more likely to have worked in the lower paying public or nonprofit sector don t ask about salary history for new hire and it really reduces the impact of previous discrimination m babcock said i think that is the most effective thing organization can do make work easier for mother research ha found that salary at men and woman s first job out of school are fairly similar the gender pay gap widens a few year later when woman start having child sometimes their pay lag because they take break from work when their child are young work fewer hour or take more time off than men for child care crisis sometimes their employer assume they ll do so even if they don t policy that help keep woman in the work

company hubspot shortstack forbes hootsuite quicksprout and others all claim to have the answer to such seemingly simple question a when is the best time to post on facebook and how often should you post story on facebook however many of the strategy used by publisher for optimizing engagement and boosting referral traffic from social are flawed using data from leading publisher we will dispel the myth and demonstrate that there are no universal best time to share content on facebook we analyzed the median traffic that article received from facebook three hour after they were shared using the median for all story and a year s worth of data helped ensure the analysis wasn t skewed by outlier our analysis garnered some fascinating discovery firstly when we compared three major publisher of national and international news based in south america france and the u k we found significant variance in the shape of the traffic profile for each publisher a can be seen in the above chart the south american publisher achieved best performance when sharing between 11am and 4pm and poor performance at other time the british and french publisher meanwhile achieved more consistent result throughout the day although both experienced peak in referral traffic at different time it s clear there is no one size fit all approach for publisher even if they are in the same category optimal time vary depending on the location of the audience one explanation for this could be that daily routine and behavior vary between country and culture which therefore impact medium consumption pattern the natural next question is whether there are country wide best time for posting story on facebook could it be that reader in france all consume content more consistently throughout the day than the south american can there be specific guide per country we compared traffic data from that same french news publisher with a top 10 french sport publisher of similar size and found that while before 10am they achieved similar result the curve then diverge by early afternoon the news publisher is enjoying a strong peak in traffic whilst the sport publisher is in a pronounced trough overall the sport publisher s traffic is more consistent with fewer dramatic peak and trough while the news publisher ha clearly demarked period when more reader are clicking through to their story even for two publication of equivalent size working in the same country there are stark difference in audience behavior depending on the subject matter of the content we also compared two similar publication in the same country and looked at the traffic profile of two top 10 french news publisher there were still crucial difference when one publisher experienced a peak in share performance at 11am it is in fact one of the worst time for the other publisher to be sharing interestingly there also seems to be significant variance based on article topic we looked at 220 000 facebook post made by our publisher client between march 20 and july 10 2016 and sorted them according to the time of day at which they were shared we then compared performance of post based on whether the article were about sport or technology all share were obtained using local time in order to compensate for time zone difference then normalized by average client performance and volume again there are important difference and these nuance help u understand the characteristic of audience and their varying appetite for particular content type at different time of the day but even these description of the individual publisher do not do the subtlety of the data justice to get the most accurate picture a publisher would need to perform this analysis again on a real time basis due to strong daily

complex process for the body and brain to deal with first your brain produce the truth which it then ha to suppress before inventing the lie and the performance of that lie this often lead to a longer pause than normal before answering plus a verbal stalling technique like why do you ask that rather than a direct and open response the eye dart human have more eye expression than any other animal and our eye can give away if we re trying to hide something when we look up to our left to think we re often accessing recalled memory but when our eye roll up to our right we can be thinking more creatively also the guilt of a lie often make people use an eye contact cut off gesture such a looking down or away the lost breath bending the truth cause an instant stress response in most people meaning the fight or flight mechanism are activated the mouth dry the body sweat more the pulse rate quickens and the rhythm of the breathing change to shorter shallower breath that can often be both

the middle of the performed lie the best time to spot these in real life is to look for the facial expression that occurs after the liar ha finished speaking the mouth might skew or the eye roll in an instant give away heckling hand the hardest body part to act with are the hand or foot and liar often struggle to keep them on message while they lie when the gesture and the word are at odds it s

make a third riddick movie", "context": "filmmaking in 2013 riddick the third vin diesel film to feature that title anti hero is an indie feature that mean even vin diesel who thanks to the fast and furious movie star in one of the most popular film franchise in existence had to independently finance the third riddick movie how did he get here let s start with the chronicle of riddick the sequel to pitch black which wa released on june 11 2004 the film which cost around 110 million grossed just 57 million at the north american box office making it one of that summer s costly misfire after that result it wa understandable that a studio in this case universal wa leery about putting more money into the franchise even at this new film s reported bargain budgetary cost of 38 million maybe though that wa for the best in this new installment we find riddick diesel left for dead on a desolate planet after a lengthy recuperation segment the focus of the film shift to a group of bounty hunter who are on the planet searching for riddick so riddick the character shift from our hero to a riddick director david twohy call him the bogey man it s something twohy who also directed the previous two installment say would never have happened had this been a straightforward studio movie did you ever think this third movie would ever happen after the chronicle of riddick underperformed yeah i had my doubt after the second one and we suffered some sling and arrow according to the studio we spent way too much money and didn t make enough back so that s never a good formula so i had my doubt if you speak with vin i m thinking he would say never a doubt that we were going to do a third movie because that s just the kind of guy he is he is a big dreamer i m more the pragmatist of the duo vin diesel ha had quite the resurgence over the last couple of year look i ve learned never to count vin diesel out just don t do that and i guess it s because he is a very smart guy smarter than people give him credit for i enjoyed that in riddick the stake are big to the character but not compared to all of the big summer movie we just saw these people basically just need to leave a planet and that s it and look i ve been in those meeting too where it s we have to up the stake we have to give it a ticking clock so i hope that riddick if nothing else feel a little more handmade than factory made that s what i set out to do and vin wa certainly along for that ride too the first half hour we re pretty much alone with riddick then the film focus on the bounty hunter and riddick becomes almost the bad guy even though we spent the first part of the movie with him that s right now that s something the studio would have fret out about wait a second you are totally sympathetic with riddick while he s trying to survive but then you re using him a the bogey man why did you want to do that because he is both those thing he is a man he is a survivor a survivor with skill and enough personal code that he can be sympathetic to u but at the same time never let the audience forget that he s a stone cold killer but you know i think it work because i have to introduce those new character i have like 10 new character to establish and i can bolster riddick s roar his legend by having them talk about him a they glimpse him do you think the success of the fast and furious movie helped to get riddick made yes but here s the cyclical nature of the business because pitch black did well that allowed him to be part of the fast and furious franchise and guess what what go around come around so on the basis of that he wa dropped into a major part in the fast and the furious and based on the success of that yes that doe impact on our ability to launch this third one even though universal didn t want to make it at a certain point in fact they didn t make it do you know that story i do not it go like this after chronicle they said we are out of the riddick business it s just a straight business calculation of u you spent too much money and you didn t make enough back so no we re not going to do anymore vin being the savvy guy he is said well give me the right back and they didn t want to do that i think this wa about the time that fast 3 had already shot and they were testing it maybe it wasn t testing a well a it should have and they decide maybe we need a cameo from vin because he wasn t in that movie so i do believe that in his savviness vin said don t pay me for that cameo just give me the right back so his company basically control the right and because i control all of the sequel and remake so we can t make a movie without each other nor would we want to so that s how he got the right back and i think that wa a great business move so ultimately we did it a an independent movie i wrote a spec script we sold it in berlin for international we came back into town looking for a domestic partner i thought it wa going to be sony or film district they were both eager to have the movie and then guess what universal raise their hand well what about u and i said this doesn t feel right to me but vin he wa saying that wa then this is now so with the fast and furious franchise and his relationship with universal over that and the strength of those we placed it again at universal so the company that kicked u to the curb laugh picked up the movie and will be distributing it in the u s and canada so universal didn t put any money into the film they put money into it for their domestic distribution right so riddick is an indie film here s an example of how it s an indie film i wrote a spec script we sold that we went up to montreal and i think i did one polish on my original script and then we shot that then when it come to editing i got to the point when i wanted to show it to 50 people in a room just to see what they understood what wa clear to them and what wa not clear to them because of thing aren t clear to them the audience can t enjoy it and i still have time to go to the editing room and clean it up i didn t have it scored and didn t fill out form i just stood in front of them and asked them question i had the studio head in

toilet considering all of the crazy thing that have been found in them when these feeling of insecurity strike we usually reach for the nearest available seat cover and if one isn t available we then make one of our own out of toilet paper this lifehack may seem like a perfectly harmless even safe practice but in truth creating this protective paper barrier could be doing you way more harm than good study have found that where we perceive bacteria thriving in bathroom can be completely backwards and what we use to keep u clean could actually be spreading the problem around read below to learn how bacteria is spread in all bathroom and what step we should be taking to keep scary bathroom germ at bay there is a general misconception that covering toilet seat keep you safe from germ but toilet seat are actually designed to keep a much bacteria off of you a possible according to today com germ are not easily spreadable on toilet seat since many different bacteria and virus don t survive long outside of a human body their special shape and material were specifically designed to prevent bacteria from dwelling on their surface for very long despite this many people opt to line the seat with toilet paper but really this seemingly clean practice may actually be increasing your exposure to germ toilet paper unlike toilet seat are not designed to ward off bacteria in fact they re sponge for it with every flush germ are sprayed up and out of the toilet and often exposed right onto the toilet paper but toilet paper isn t the only place where germ dwell more happily than toilet seat in fact a study from the the journal of applied microbiology found that hand dryer were among the largest distributor of bacteria other than flushing toilet the powerful buffeting of dryer propels germ around the room and onto your hand which can grow and increase especially if you don t dry them completely though they are definitely more environmentally friendly these dryer actually spread more germ than ordinary paper towel so what s the best way to ensure you re not spreading or picking up germ closing the toilet seat lid before flushing if the toilet doesn t have a lid remember that bacteria thrives in warm wet place so keep any surface dry including your hand your body and any of the bathroom appliance washing your hand is extremely important after you use the restroom but drying them thoroughly and disposing of your paper towel is just a important our skin doe a great job of blocking bacteria so trust in it ability to do it job when sitting on a dry toilet

that long ago it wa just an app commonly associated with sexting it foundation in disappearing message the once unique feature that made snapchat a must have made sending naughty material seem le

the footage simply by moving their phone wa really cool by turning my phone he continued i get a whole new vantage point of his own amateur sex footage he mean and maybe one day someone else s the idea wa an obvious one for some snapchat user rachel and richard included right after the initial spectacle rollout people were already cracking the same joke on social medium the idea wa practically

with their new toy yet most of them have at least had the idea i hadn t thought about that a a personal use but one of my first thought wa when we d see this pop up in porn one early spectacle owner explained my friend have talked about all the possibility that can be made with these including sex another said the spec will definitely be 1000 le creepier than google glass of course there s the idea and then the execution and people have definitely been executing on the potential for spectacle a a sex toy so far review are mixed of the 26 spectacle owner we spoke with mashable did hear from several people who wore the glass during masturbation foreplay and sex i ve used it by myself just to dance around and be sexual and also used it in the beginning stage of sex when i wa still getting intimate with a partner rachel the medium entrepreneur said with the glass on it definitely take you out of the moment a little bit the experience wasn t seamless rachel and her partner chose to wear one pair of glass and pas them back and forth during foreplay spectacle also only record up to 30 second with the press of the button three time it definitely take you out of the moment a little bit she said it wasn t rachel s first time making a home sex video and while she appreciated the new visceral perspective spectacle had to offer wearing the glass were a bit distracting and made her feel more than a little self conscious there wa a barrier in term of personal space i didn t feel a close to the person because one of u had the sunglass on she said jennifer a publicist said she and her partner both wore them the first time which felt fun but two pair of spectacle make for strange bedfellow literally to say nothing of the viewing itself we thought we would try it but the first five minute we were laughing i think teal the color of her spectacle wa a bad choice she said i deleted the video right after and we tried again a series of 10 20 and 30 second clip are now saved on her personal iphone which jennifer said she s privately masturbated to and also sent to her boyfriend while rachel had the idea to use them for sex early on in her spectacle ownership she wa initially concerned about whether or not her video would post instantly to her story they don t the app save all spectacle video in a dedicated tab within your snapchat memory still due to privacy concern she downloads the story off of the app deletes them from snapchat and then store them in a personal private folder i m a little skeptical about how much snapchat can see she said richard and jennifer

spectacle but one could still and isn t unlikely to show up in the near future jesse adam co founder and ceo of adult content app platform mikandi say his company is already looking at the potential

wearable camera google glass and used it to create an app called tit and glass a well a film a parody porn video back in 2013 the question is what appeal will these spectacle have if any to this industry will they see these a a different kind of pov niche that it might be able to financially profit from or build a more general porn viewership said lynn comella associate professor of gender and sexuality study at university of nevada la vega will it be different from google glass snap declined to comment for this story but a spokesperson pointed to the snapchat support and safety page for reference spectacle support page ha no direct mention of using spectacle during sex the gadget s warning page address flying and driving however all sex related context is for now designated to the community guideline for snap and snapchat that s not too surprising given that spectacle only upload video directly to snapchat a pornography section of it community guideline state snapchat prohibits account that use public story to distribute sexually explicit content there s no control or limitation to what user do with snapchat privately of course cindy gallop an advertising industry

could win", "context": "joe raedle getty image at this moment poll show a strong upswing for donald trump s campaign he s made real ground on hillary clinton closing the gap between them by consolidating the republican party behind his candidacy clinton meanwhile is fighting a contentious primary which keep her from doing the same there s still a strong case to make that donald trump is a long shot for the white house that he s too unpopular with too many american outside the republican party and that if the obama coalition hold he loses jamelle bouie jamelle bouie is slate s chief political correspondent at least that s what i think but humility is a virtue and life is volatile even if election often aren t that trump is a poor bet for november doesn t mean he couldn t win he could which raise an obvious question how would it happen and finding an answer here isn t too difficult you just need to reverse engineer the condition of a trump loss what are those condition at the top of the list is demographic trump is deeply unpopular with black and latino voter a well a with woman and young people but clinton is also unpopular albeit by a smaller magnitude given two unpopular candidate it s possible that popularity just won t matter a much that voter will take both candidate worst quality a a given and move on in which case both clinton and trump become generic nominee and what are the prospect this year for a generic republican nominee of five separate econometric model of the election four predict a republican win ranging from 50 9 percent of the vote to 55 percent of the two party vote the economy is middling president obama well liked but not hugely popular and clinton would be a third term for democrat given two generic candidate under those criterion the presidency would go to the republican say hello to president trump let s say you don t trust the model they couldn t predict trump after all then what how would trump win assuming key part of the electorate are aligned against him the answer is easy he win and turn out white voter in historic number assume higher nonwhite support for the democrat let s say a three point bump among black and a seven point bump among hispanic giving clinton 97 percent and 80 percent support respectively and trump need 66 percent of white to win both the popular and electoral college vote if turnout doesn t change you can play with the number over at realclearpolitics how would trump win assuming key part of the electorate are aligned against him he turn out white voter in historic number it s an extraordinary reach an increase of nearly six point over the white share in 2012 matching ronald reagan s performance in 1984 it would mean trump persuaded million of democrat to switch team despite their wide approval for president obama in other word it s not happening partisanship ha a tight hold on american voting behavior and it s hard to imagine how trump could break it barring a national catastrophe easier to imagine is higher white turnout if trump could reverse the yearslong decline and bring white turnout back to it 2008 level 74 percent then he could win with another couple percentage point among white even with the high black and latino turnout of 2008 this would give him teetering democratic state such a new hampshire pennsylvania and wisconsin a well a the three largest swing state florida ohio and virginia it s a heavy lift especially for a candidate who say he will eschew data gathering and other quantitative method for finding and mobilizing supporter but it s possible ok ok possible doesn t mean likely and it s hard to imagine a disorganized campaign exceeding team romney s ability to pinpoint and bring republican leaning white voter to the poll still with a smile from fortuna or whichever god of chance you prefer trump can win if anything guarantee defeat for an incumbent party it s a recession at the opening of the 1960 election in early spring of that year john f kennedy and richard nixon were neck and neck this continued into the summer and the early fall but by october kennedy had opened a small but persistent lead he won it s hard to isolate a single cause for kennedy s victory but he wa almost certainly helped along by the modest recession that struck in the spring and lasted until the following winter if not for that downturn there s a fair chance nixon would have become president a sudden slowdown could have the same effect on our election in fact the very presence of trump his proximity to the most powerful office in the world could destabilize market and make a downturn more likely and consider this on average the united state see a recession every five year we re due one is all we need for president trump a terrorist attack could do it driving voter into the arm of the authoritarian in the race but the literature is mixed on how terrorism affect voter it could make them more attuned to perceived outsider and immigrant in particular giving trump an advantage it could push them toward hawkish candidate with traditional credential helping clinton or given the candidate it could be a wash so let s table this one there s one last thing that could deliver the white house to trump a divided democratic party party unity is a prerequisite for national competition it s why the never trump movement fell apart after ted cruz left the race a serious effort to derail the republican nominee would guarantee a democratic white house because it s almost impossible to overcome the asymmetry in the still unlikely event that the present acrimony between bernie sander and the democratic party becomes an outright split democrat risk throwing the election to trump through in fighting and division if sander run a a third party candidate the game is over and democrat lose you see this in the most recent polling clinton s biggest weakness in the nbc news survey of registered voter is with sander backer who haven t crossed the threshold to team clinton if this persists it s dangerous if history is any indication however it won t be with all this said even the most probable scenario here that trump and clinton become generic candidate is a distant long shot they re just too well known for voter to treat them a interchangeable with any republican or any democrat and their personal quality

trump won latino over marco rubio and ted cruz here s why", "context": "strange but true why the republican frontrunner just might be able to build on his success with latino voter in nevada and win the white house a a result we know about the reagan democrat in the 1980s union member in blue state defied their leader in organized labor to vote for the 40th president well in nevada the first of the early primary or caucus state with a significant number of latino voter we ve caught a glimpse of a similar phenomenon one that few could have imagined when donald trump entered the race for the republican presidential nomination you may recall that the billionaire businessman launched his foray into politics eight month ago with a speech that declared that mexican immigrant were bringing drug and bringing crime and that they were rapist criminal and murderer even though he assumed some are good people now it seems some of those good people are enamored of their tormentor behold the trump latino according to cnn entrance poll among latino republican voter in the silver state john kasich got 4 percent ted cruz 18 percent and marco rubio 29 percent trump got an astounding 44 percent i can only think of two people who don t seem surprised by trump s strong showing with latino the first is trump himself who ha been saying for month that he would do well with hispanic in fact trump would often point to early polling from nevada that showed him beating his rival decisively with hispanic which is what happened trump ha a theory he think that hispanic know that he will create job and that many of these job will go to hispanic because his year in business have taught him that hispanic are especially hard worker the other person who saw this coming wa me two week ago i wrote a piece for this site that looked at the phenomenon of latino for trump that piece wa criticized by everyone from white democrat to latino activist to republican supported other candidate now if you look at the entrance poll out of nevada it seems clear that these critic don t know much about latino granted these survey are not the definitive final word this wa a small sample of voter and many polling expert doubt the accuracy of entrance poll besides we are talking about just latino republican who went to vote on a given day in the state of nevada that s hardly a representative sample of latino across the country and finally it is worth noting most latino weren t even on the table for republican in nevada because more than two third of the community are registered democrat in fact if trump is ultimately the republican nominee it will almost assure a latino landslide for hillary clinton who could walk away with a much a 80 percent of the latino vote still all those caveat and condition don t change what happened in nevada or it significance we need to unpack that but first let me explain a few thing about my tribe the 54 million latino in the united state whose ancestor can be traced to more than a dozen country could yield an estimated 13 million voter in november and many of those voter will be in three battleground state nevada colorado and florida next there is no suspense a to which party will scoop up the lion s share of those vote it s the same party that ha won the majority of latino vote in every presidential election since 1960 the democratic party no republican presidential candidate ha ever won the majority of latino vote finally while many in washington will often try to compare latino with african american a another aggrieved minority that ha endured everything from inferior school to overt discrimination to economic inequality there is a competing line of thought that suggests latino are more comparable to other catholic immigrant group like the irish and italian like their european immigrant brother latino want to come to their ethnicity on their own term they are fiercely patriotic american who nonetheless identify a latino and they don t feel a if they must choose one over the other that is relevant to this discussion because a one reader put it to me recently if these voter think like american they ll vote for trump if they think like latino they won t now here s what happened in nevada the latino community in the united state and especially the nearly 70 percent of that population that is mexican or mexican american is highly aspirational they don t settle they want better life for themselves and their child they want success they don t hate trump they want to be trump in state like nevada colorado texas utah and others far away from the nation s power triangle new york boston washington there were many average latino living ordinary life who are being drawn to trump and his promise to make america great again like many other american who are flocking to the real estate mogul these latino want to know what it s like to live in a country that is always winning and winning and what about trump s inflammatory comment about mexico and immigration along our southern border it s complicated while generally more appreciative than other american of immigration respectful of the contribution of legal and illegal immigrant and supportive of a comprehensive reform plan that provides the undocumented with a path to earned legal status many latino are also ambivalent about illegal immigration especially if they or their ancestor came legally they re leery of immigrant who abuse the system and feel entitled to make demand of the country that took them in while waving the flag of the country that cast them adrift they re also fed up with what they see a a new militancy among the undocumented immigrant of today particularly young dream er who were brought here a child and seem to understand everything about this country except what it demand of it citizen and those who aspire to be citizen like trump these latino voter know something is wrong with the nation s immigration

west s nickname yeezy and jesus the album also feature a direct kanye jesus comparison in the song i am a god i know he the most high but i am a close high with kanye bringing a jesus lookalike on stage during his current tour the huffington post decided now is a good time to compare the relative place of kanye and jesus in the popular zeitgeist to do this we analyzed a year s worth of twitter data from oct 21 2012 to oct 20 2013 via the third party service topsy when comparing jesus and kanye on twitter the first question is what term should we use for the comparison there are a lot term twitter user use to reference jesus there s the broad jesus which includes other people named jesus the more specific jesus christ and foreign language version jesucristo in spanish gesu cristo in italian some user also tag the name resulting in mention for jesus there are a lot fewer version of kanye kanye which includes other people named kanye though there are far le people named kanye than jesus kanye west and kanyewest there are also nominal instance of people tweeting his nickname like yeezy and ye since jesus doesn t have a genuine twitter account and kanye ha a habit of deleting all of his tweet using mention didn t seem that promising or fair looking to minimize instance of other people named jesus and kanye we decided to start our search comparing kanye west with jesus christ according to the data in the last year worldwide looking at only original tweet no retweets no reply jesus christ had 3 936 585 mention while kanye west had 4 541 349 mention pretty impressive for the 36 year old rapper while west s total wa greater overall on a typical day kanye didn t have more tweet than jesus kanye s number were skewed by a few high mention day and his median tweet day 9 981 were in fact lower than jesus s median tweet day 10 458 in fact jesus had more tweet on the majority of day 187 out of the 365 day in the year so using kanye west v jesus christ their twitter mention are pretty close but what about the foreign language tweet kanye ha an advantage with foreign language tweet because country with the latin derived alphabet a far a we know refer to kanye west a kanye west while a mentioned above there are many different way to reference jesus only looking at the united state offer a clearer picture although there are some resident in the u s who speak foreign language jesus christ is generally used a the identifier here again using kanye west v jesus christ kanye had slightly more mention overall 2 429 931 to 2 224 895 but they were about equal when the day to day total received consideration breaking it down state by state some state tweeted more about jesus orange state while other state tweeted more about kanye green state when did user tweet the most about jesus and kanye kanye west s top five day 1 8 26 2013 90 993 tweet the day after his blood on the leaf performance at the vmas 2 12 31 2012 70 701 tweet new year eve kim kardashian

you look at the stream of jesus christ tweet you will quickly notice a complication a large amount of the jesus christ tweet are idiomatic i just stubbed my toe jesus christ notblessed and don t actually refer to the literal jesus christ usage of the exclamatory jesus christ is probably more popular among those who are at least exposed to christianity so it may still be a good signal for jesus s popularity among the twitterati that being said the idiomatic jesus christ doesn t directly refer to the person jesus christ while kanye west refers to the person kanye in almost all case so if we re looking for an apple to apple comparison then jesus christ s number are significantly smaller how much smaller we looked at a sample of the hundred most recent tweet for jesus christ on twitter using the twitter search and found that 73 percent of us of jesus christ were idiomatic leaving 27 percent literal this search occurred during a tense soccer match lot of jesus christ exclamation and is too small of a sample to offer definitive conclusion but it signal that the idiomatic jesus christ is accounting for a significant portion of the examined mention so what happens if you compare jesus v kanye jesus had significantly more tweet kanye had 10 412 097 tweet compared to jesus s 51 724 902 tweet looking again at a sample of the hundred latest tweet to gauge what s going on we see the following breakdown idiomatic 22 literal 70 other person s name 8 this sample is again too small to prove definitive but even if only 25 percent of those tweet that contain the word jesus refer to the religious figure jesus would still have more literal tweet than kanye and the proportion of tweet referring to jesus appears to be much higher than that we also haven t accounted for different name for jesus in language other than english when you break it down by region mention of jesus are more popular than kanye pretty much everywhere so it look like jesus is the most high

account every two or three day i just thought it wa such a good idea to set it and forget it said rhoads who say she is like a squirrel in her approach to saving digit sends text with balance update which she largely ignores because i like to pretend the saving is not happening getting consumer comfortable with putting their finance on customized autopilot starting with a simple no fee and no interest saving account is the san francisco startup s mission in two year it user have saved more than 350 million this way according to it 31 year old founder and chief executive officer ethan bloch when the product moved out of pilot mode in february 2015 user were saving about 1 million a month now that s more than 35 million a month digit won t disclose the size of it user base but say it ha tripled from about a year ago digit had a saving bot before bot were cool or at least before the hype in the financial technology world reached a fever pitch it product is simple an algorithm look at a user s average high and low checking account balance when the user is paid and whether the pay cycle is smooth or choppy then after looking for bill due in the next week or two and analyzing recent spending it move an amount it judge the customer won t miss to a saving account the company make money from the interest rate it get on account asset digit announced today that it will be the first saving bot on facebook messenger s platform so user can just use facebook to communicate with it when digit moved out of it pilot phase it communicated only by text a natural language for many user since 17 percent of them are aged 21 to 24 and 44 percent are from 25 to 34 year old rhoads said they re cute text with some personality and not annoying at all after text messaging came io and android apps for user the company is now working on what bloch called the first artificial intelligence powered financial goal program user would set a date and amount and pick an emoji of course and digit s algorithm would make a series of projection based on balance to determine the optimal amount needed to start saving toward that goal or point out that the goal is unrealistic also on the product horizon is having digit s algorithm figure out how to move every dollar where it should go at the right time to minimize fee on student loan credit card account etc and maximize gain bloch said there are hitch since digit isn t a bank it can t pay interest and it will be competing in an environment of rising rate bloch said interest rate are not a huge deal for his customer because they regularly withdraw money and tend to save small sum another hurdle is that traditional bank technology can make it hard to connect account bank have not made it easy for customer to get their data bloch said because of that digit and product like acorn venmo betterment every day we have bank difficulty that affect thousand of customer behavioral finance underlies much of digit s design take the goal function for example if user get more specific about what they are saving for research suggests they are le likely to withdraw the money if an account is labeled charlie s education fund i ll think harder about withdrawing it than if it s just labeled saving bloch said currently 70 percent of digit user withdraw 80 percent of their saving every 90 day mainly to pay bill and meet short term need for cash to pay off debt or pay for travel bloch s broadest long term goal is to make digit s user interface far more conversational to humanize it so user feel more in control when they communicate with it we want to make digit understand more not a broad a alexa or siri but widen the aperture a little more related to finance and your money he said one day it would be awesome to say

brevity maya kachroo levine you ve had investment of over 1 million yield a 13 return 130 000 in just one year can you speak to your investment strategy that year and can you walk u through your 2016 investment strategy jp livingston my investment strategy for several year ha been a twist on a broadly discussed strategy to go long on equity many financial expert those who aren t compensated for getting you to invest a certain way will tell you that if you are young and in the wealth accumulation phase of your life to consider parking your money in a low cost index fund for example vanguard s total stock market index fund vtsax there are a few key argument for this strategy first it s a nice hedge against inflation because the company in the index are presumably raising their price with inflation since company are valued on a multiple of revenue or profit this will be captured in the growth of the stock market secondly and most importantly is that it s hard to argue with it result the compound annual growth rate for stock on the s p index for the last 30 year ha been 11 there are very few if any opportunity available to u regular individual investor that can top that kind of return for the risk note you ll get an entirely different view from hedge fund or mutual fund they believe they can beat market return and so they charge high fee for their time and effort a few of them are worth it most of them are not kachroo levine what are you planning on changing about your strategy in 2017 livingston a a retiree steady cash flow is going to matter more to me than it ha in the past there are only two way to make money appreciation and income stock for example are about appreciation you make very little money on a regular basis usually a puny 1 2 in dividend but a year or two or three later you can sell it for much more than you paid and pocket the difference a heavily appreciation based strategy like going 100 into index fund will no longer meet my need income based strategy by contrast put a steady paycheck in the spotlight bond are generally purchased for the interest they provide sure they can appreciate or depreciate in value but the bulk of your return from a bond come from the monthly or quarterly dividend it pay i have a few year to build myself an income based strategy a i still have some deferred compensation coming from my old employer but i m looking to add one or two rental property to my portfolio in 2017 interest rate are still fairly low so it s not a bad time to be a borrower i would also look at adding more bond to my portfolio specifically leveraged municipal bond fund the leverage juice return and municipal bond are tax exempt but i do not want to buy bond right now a the fed ha signaled a plan to increase interest rate and even raised them just a week ago kachroo levine what are your financial investment goal for 2017 what are your priority livingston a i am newly retired my main priority is transitioning my portfolio into more income based opportunity that can provide steady money to cover my expense each year i m on the lookout for a rental property or two to take advantage of low interest rate and which will provide some much needed steady income in some part of the country like san francisco rental property are actually negative cash flow exercise and are predicated on appreciation in some area it will throw off 6 7 or more in income each year and fit my income need real estate is hyperlocal like that kachroo levine what are the key philosophy that help shape your investment strategy livingston i feel i ve gotten pretty far on just two thing first don t be afraid to say you don t know people get really weird and insecure when it come to money we re all lifelong learner i have to admit i don t know basic thing all the time for example while i ve read quite a bit about real estate investment i m constantly finding myself with a giant question mark a i apply those concept to my first live investment my priority though is to make money and learn not to impress people second don t give up until you really feel you understand something finally my other silver bullet question is to ask what are the argument against it or what are the three thing that could break this strategy there s no free lunch every strategy ha some vulnerability kachroo levine what advice can you offer for novice investor in 2017 specifically if you were speaking to people who had never invested beyond a 401 k or ira what would you say to them livingston you are in such an exciting place because there is low hanging fruit all around you a few thing 1 money management is an incremental game not a winner take all game that mean every tweak you make ha a noticeable impact on your money and it mean you don t have to choose between going whole hog or absolute zero you can devote however much time and effort you have and get proportional result and new idea to employ 2 momentum matter most start by joining a few interesting community and blog and read a little bit a few time a week cruise around on the reddit personal finance forum investment is only painful or boring when you try to cram too much too fast or you go find a dry educational source and force feed yourself the information momentum is the most important piece when you start any new project too many people think alright it s time to do this investment stuff and go and buy some highly rated book on amazon to start their education that s such a self defeating way to start is that how you got into skiing or guitar or interpretive celtic dance ha that kind of textbook strategy ever succeeded in firing up your passion kachroo levine for those seeking early retirement can you share why your investment are so crucial to your early retirement journey livingston your nest egg is like an entire extra employee doing work for you an employee that get better and stronger and eventually eclipse you say you make 100 000 pre tax and save 30 000 a year once your nest egg is three time your salary or 300 000 at a 10 return it will generate a much a you slaving a whole year to put away ha accomplished at 10 time your salary and a 10 return it is throwing off more money than you make in an entire year you could be sitting on the beach drinking mai tai and still see a year s worth of salary come in just from your investment of course you can t guarantee consistent 10 return but you have a long term bet that you can achieve during your accumulation phase by investing in low cost index fund more on forbes",

obviously you both share story credit with j k rowling how did it work having three writer in the mix john tiffany jo rowling wa incredibly generous i met her first and i already had a soft spot for her because she used to write in the cafe of the traverse theater in edinburgh when i wa the director it wa only after the first book came out that i realized it had been her nursing one cappuccino for four hour when we met to talk about the play she asked what do you think the harry potter story are about i said learning to deal with death and grief there wa something in her eye i thought we didn t say it s about transformation or magic or flying on broom and we re on the right track thorne we all met in edinburgh and a the day developed we knew we would take the epilogue of harry potter and the deathly hallows a a starting point tiffany all the seed are there we start with that scene in the train station am i allowed to say that anyway it wa clear that she wa going to let u take those character and have our own idea callender of course jack came to the table with an encyclopedic knowledge of harry so that helped thorne all right i m a nerd with abandonment issue did you really sketch out the whole arc of the story in that first meeting thorne yes but then it took about six month to really map the whole thing out every time it wa like taking a big step forward one or two small one back jo would say this feel right this doesn t tiffany there are part of the story which when we first conceived them i didn t think she would let u do but she never hesitated it is one thing to let u continue the story another to let u unravel the canon friedman that s enough wa the idea of a two part play there from the beginning tiffany no not at all but we knew we had to deal with going beyond where the book left off but also go back and look at the story within them we wanted to develop the character that are already known and keep that consistency but also introduce new one it wa clearly hard to put an epic tale into two and a half hour we had a meeting and said why not two part and we knew right away how we wanted to end the first part it s a cliffhanger noma dumezweni it doe that wonderful thing that book do when they work it make you desperate for more story how is it different telling that story a a play rather than a novel thorne we can tell the story of the younger and older generation at the same time which the book didn t do the exciting thing ha been working out how those world fit together it s a coming of age story a much for the adult a for the child john and i are more or le the same age a harry in the play and i just had my first child so there ha been a lot of discussion about growing up being a parent tiffany how do you mother or father when you still need parenting yourself dumezweni also i think the difference with a play is that you re not experiencing the story on your own the way you do with a book being in the theater is a communal experience and this play with two part is a commitment i m fascinated to see what my daughter will think after a whole day in the theater a an actor it s something i ve never experienced before what about dealing with the issue of magic in the theater where you can t create the kind of effect that happen in film tiffany film ha got green screen we ve got the imagination of the audience how do you feel jamie and noma playing character that a huge fan base feel so possessive about is it intimidating dumezweni i think jamie found it very intimidating everyone laugh parker it s not so different from playing any role that is within a canon you have the responsibility of being sensitive to the collective investment in the story but you just have to try to serve the play the best way you can and not worry about that dumezweni the weight of expectation is huge but for me that pressure ha been outweighed by getting text message from mum i know saying how huge it is for their mixed race daughter that i am playing hermione ultimately it s a theater piece i m a theater actor and doing a job a best i can ha it been difficult to work under condition of intense secrecy and what about when preview start and people are talking about the play online callender i m hopeful after seeing how people were about star war they mostly protected the fan tiffany it will be a relief when the text is published when the play officially open on july 30 so that it s not our secret to keep but if you don t read it and you choose not to read review we ve made it possible to come without prior knowledge parker and you don t get that much nowadays so often thing are ruined because you know so much dumezweni i ve quite loved the secrecy although of course my home life is expletive my daughter try to guess what is in the play she say just smile at me if i m right tiffany my mum is the only problem everyone else is fine she asks really specific question then i

although nicotine addiction is considered one of the strongest addiction even more addictive than cocaine the good news is that the physical side of thing doesn t last very long in fact some believe that you will lose the physical craving for nicotine in a little a 3 day the real struggle for smoker is overcoming the mental addiction the smoker ha essentially trained their subconscious mind to make smoking an automatic behavior these are the habit and ritual that a smoker ha developed over the year such a smoking when they wake up just before they go to sleep after they eat when they drive

offer through verbal suggestion that deem smoking a something undesirable or unnecessary to do gradually these suggestion take hold and diminish the smoker s impulse to smoke furthermore hypnotherapy is considered to be a far more safe and natural method to quit smoking with and is non habit forming this cannot be said about most of the stop smoking aid we currently have on the market but going to a hypnotist can be expensive a much a 200 per one hour session and requiring a many a 5 session for the entire treatment if you re a celebrity like the one mentioned earlier then this isn t a problem but can the average smoker afford to go to a hypnotherapist well that question is left to the individual but consider that a pack a day smoker will spend in excess of 2000 a year on cigarette not even

break down like this gross earned 290 million a his year end bonus for 2013 mohamed el erian pimco s former chief executive officer and one time heir apparent to gross received 230 million el erian is a fellow bloomberg view contributor and the story doesn t end with pimco s two most visible former employee former deputy chief investment officer daniel ivascyn now serving a gross s replacement a pimco s chief investment officer took home a 70 million bonus wendy w cupps the global head of product management garnered 50 million making her one of the highest paid woman in finance her rocky push into equity wa the subject of well publicized haranguing by gross douglas hodge now the ceo took home 45 million of holiday cheer these giant bonus almost make the 22 million awarded to pimco s president jay jacob seem puny the top three manager after gross and el erian ivascyn cupps and jacob were rumored to have been behind the coup that sent gross packing to janus capital in september next month free of gross and el erian these three will have an extra half a billion or so to keep to themselves or distribute to the other managing director gross s bonus 20 percent of the total bonus pool for 2013 place him in a compensation class of his very own to put that figure into context in 2013 gross made just shy of what the next 20 publicly held finance company ceo made combined in the world of sport you would have to take the total salary winning and endorsement deal of lebron james lionel messi kobe bryant tiger wood and roger federer together to be on par with gross how pimco became such an earnings machine is a quirk it ha been four decade since it wa spun out of pacific life insurance co a move that wa made in part to allow gross a freer hand to manage the insurer s fixed income portfolio since then pimco ha grown into a behemoth in term of the bottom line and a a force in the bond market much of what we know about pimco stem from allianz se s 3 3 billion purchase of 70 percent of the firm in 2000 a publicly traded german insurer allianz ha released some detail about pimco s operation in it quarterly earnings report that data along with mutual fund disclosure and filing provide hint about the firm s revenue we can estimate earnings by looking at the largest pimco fund the 20 biggest have an average fee of about 61 basis point let s lower that to account for discount given to large institutional client and we get a rough estimate of about 50 basis point on 1 82 trillion dollar that yield 9 1 billion in revenue a year pimco is by any measure a fabulously wealthy company using my back of the envelope revenue estimate it generates far more revenue per employee than any bank or asset manager almost four time a much a goldman sachs when allianz bought into pimco it picked up about 250 billion in asset under management pimco currently manages about 2 trillion the bonus structure is a quirk of that original deal allianz partial purchase left pacific life owning 30 percent of pimco but pacific life wasn t interested in running the asset management business and even after the allianz deal everyone involved continued to defer to gross s financial and managerial judgment thus pimco based in newport beach california and 6 000 mile removed from it majority owner remained fully autonomous bloomberg view s fee analysis suggests allianz take about 70 percent of the total revenue pimco generates annually plus or minus a few percentage point pimco keep the rest this same deal structure continued even after allianz purchased the 30 percent of pimco that it didn t already own from pacific life in the mid 2000s a subsequent restructuring in 2011 saw gross and his team gain even greater control over the firm that gave pimco so much freedom in relation to it corporate parent that a one analyst described it to bloomberg news it appeared a if it wa the tail wagging the dog part of the reason for gross s longevity after the allianz takeover and another element of the firm s enormous wealth is what we might call the pimco premium despite being in a competitive field including giant company such a vanguard and blackrock pimco manages to charge more than the industry standard for access to it fund and it separately managed account why when competing for business the firm ha had an unbeatable combination of a long history and outstanding long term result at least it did until recent bad bet on rising interest rate by gross torpedoed the 1 3 and 5 year record of the flagship total return fund pimco also became the go to company for the federal reserve and u s treasury in many of the credit facility used to combat the continuing economic fallout from the financial crisis pimco s success in the federal government s program to jumpstart consumer lending and a variety of mortgage backed security program added more luster to it reputation gross even managed to buy up lot of mb s before the fed officially announced the program shareholder of the total return fund netted about 10 billion from it mortgage play beyond the sheer size of pimco s bonus there are other aspect of it compensation practice that should give pause to everyone involved in institutional asset management for one pimco ha been part of a publicly traded company allianz for the past 15 year unbeknownst to allianz s shareholder employee of one of it business unit have been paying themselves these extraordinarily large sum of money in the u s it is hard to imagine 1 5 billion in spending on anything not being disclosed almost 16 percent of pimco s revenue is a material amount of money that would normally require disclosure in the u s but allianz is a german company subject to different regulation another item worth noticing pimco investor represent pension fund foundation charitable trust 401ks and other retirement account pimco s enormous self paid bonus come right off of the top of the return those outside investor might otherwise receive in a recent allianz presentation following gross departure from pimco the firm s new chief executive doug hodge stated we don t comment on matter of compensation but while gross may be gone the high fee and compensation structure at pimco appear to remain firmly in place allianz doesn t seem inclined to change thing it started a 279 million award program this fall to keep people from following gross out the door however if there is going to be change it can only come from pimco s big institutional customer why should they pay a pimco premium pimco s profit are down by 7 9 percent in the third quarter of this year and the firm saw saw almost 50 billion in outflow last month janus gross s new home ha managed to attract only about 430 million in new money since he joined the market for fixed income asset management ha never been in greater flux than it is today the realignment of power among bond manager is only just beginning if ever there wa a moment when investor could demand more competitive fee from their bond manager it is now perhaps it might also be a good time for pimco itself to consider slicing it fee anecdotally story abound of pimco institutional salesperson offering steep one year fee discount a a way to retain asset if i were managing pimco even from 6 000 mile away i would be looking at way to make those fee reduction more permanent i bet i

medical and psychosocial service to high risk area whether existing definition are appropriate entirely depends on your point of view of course it is not an awfully long time ago that rape wa regarded fundamentally not a a crime of violence against woman but a a crime against the property of men ie their wife or daughter which is why marital rape wa for so long excluded we have for the most part moved on from the deepest depth of that patriarchal approach but there any many who argue that the maintenance of phallo centric rape definition mean that the seriousness of other form of penetrative assault are underplayed brock turner s conviction and the bravely stark testimony of his victim have helped to bring these question about how sexual crime are defined and how that impact on attitude towards sentencing out into the open the tragedy is that no level of public debate or outrage can undo the despicable harm he caused to an unconscious woman read the stanford victim s full impact statement your honor if it is all right for the majority of this statement i would like to address the defendant directly you don t know me but you ve been inside me and that s why we re here today on january 17th 2015 it wa a quiet saturday night at home my dad made some dinner and i sat at the table with my younger sister who wa visiting for the weekend i wa working full time and it wa approaching my bed time i planned to stay at home by myself watch some tv and read while she went to a party with her friend then i decided it wa my only night with her i had nothing better to do so why not there s a dumb party ten minute from my house i would go dance weird like a fool and embarrass my younger sister on the way there i joked that undergrad guy would have brace my sister teased me for wearing a beige cardigan to a frat party like a librarian i called myself big mama because i knew i d be the oldest one there i made silly face let my guard down and drank liquor too fast not factoring in that my tolerance had significantly lowered since college the next thing i remember i wa in a gurney in a hallway i had dried blood and bandage on the back of my hand and elbow i thought maybe i had fallen and wa in an admin office on campus i wa very calm and wondering where my sister wa a deputy explained i had been assaulted i still remained calm assured he wa speaking to the wrong person i knew no one at this party when i wa finally allowed to use the restroom i pulled down the hospital pant they had given me went to pull down my underwear and felt nothing i still remember the feeling of my hand touching my skin and grabbing nothing i looked down and there wa nothing the thin piece of fabric the only thing between my vagina and anything else wa missing and everything inside me wa silenced i still don t have word for that feeling in order to keep breathing i thought maybe the policeman used scissors to cut them off for evidence then i felt pine needle scratching the back of my neck and started pulling them out my hair i thought maybe the pine needle had fallen from a tree onto my head my brain wa talking my gut into not collapsing because my gut wa saying help me help me i shuffled from room to room with a blanket wrapped around me pine needle trailing behind me i left a little pile in every room i sat in i wa asked to sign paper that said rape victim and i thought something ha really happened my clothes were confiscated and i stood naked while the nurse held a ruler to various abrasion on my body and photographed them the three of u worked to comb the pine needle out of my hair six hand to fill one paper bag to calm me down they said it s just the flora and fauna flora and fauna i had multiple swab inserted into my vagina and anus needle for shot pill had a nikon pointed right into my spread leg i had long pointed beak inside me and had my vagina smeared with cold blue paint to check for abrasion after a few hour of this they let me shower i stood there examining my body beneath the stream of water and decided i don t want my body anymore i wa terrified of it i didn t know what had been in it if it had been contaminated who had touched it i wanted to take off my body like a jacket and leave it at the hospital with everything else on that morning all that i wa told wa that i had been found behind a dumpster potentially penetrated by a stranger and that i should get retested for hiv because result don t always show up immediately but for now i should go home and get back to my normal life imagine stepping back into the world with only that information they gave me huge hug and then i walked out of the hospital into the parking lot wearing the new sweatshirt and sweatpants they provided me a they had only allowed me to keep my necklace and shoe my sister picked me up face wet from tear and contorted in anguish instinctively and immediately i wanted to take away her pain i smiled at her i told her to look at me i m right here i m okay everything s okay i m right here my hair is washed and clean they gave me the strangest shampoo calm down and look at me look at these funny new sweatpants and sweatshirt i look like a p e teacher let s go home let s eat something she did not know that beneath my sweat i had scratch and bandage on my skin my vagina wa sore and had become a strange dark color from all the prodding my underwear wa missing and i felt too empty to continue to speak that i wa also afraid that i wa also devastated that day we drove home and for hour my sister held me my boyfriend did not know what happened but called that day and said i wa really worried about you last night you scared me did you make it home okay i wa horrified that s when i learned i had called him that night in my blackout left an incomprehensible voicemail that we had also spoken on the phone but i wa slurring so heavily he wa scared for me that he repeatedly told me to go find my sister again he asked me what happened last night did you make it home okay i said yes and hung up to cry i wa not ready to tell my boyfriend or parent that actually i may have been raped behind a dumpster but i don t know by who or when or how if i told them i would see the fear on their face and mine would multiply by tenfold so instead i pretended the whole thing wasn t real i tried to push it out of my mind but it wa so heavy i didn t talk i didn t eat i didn t sleep i didn t interact with anyone after work i would drive to a secluded place to scream i didn t talk i didn t eat i didn t sleep i didn t interact with anyone and i became isolated from the one i loved most for one week after the incident i didn t get any call or update about that night or what happened to me the only symbol that proved that it hadn t just been a bad dream wa the sweatshirt from the hospital in my drawer one day i wa at work scrolling through the news on my phone and came across an article in it i read and learned for the first time about how i wa found unconscious with my hair disheveled long necklace wrapped around my neck bra pulled out of my dress dress pulled off over my shoulder and pulled up above my waist that i wa butt naked all the way down to my boot leg spread apart and had been penetrated by a foreign object by someone i did not recognize this wa how i learned what happened to me sitting at my desk reading the news at work i learned what happened to me the same time everyone else in the world learned what happened to me that s when the pine needle in my hair made sense they didn t fall from a tree he had taken off my underwear his finger had been inside of me i don t even know this person i still don t know this person when i read about me like this i said this can t be me this can t be me i could not digest or accept any of this information i could not imagine my family having to read about this online i kept reading in the next paragraph i read something that i will never forgive i read that according to him i liked it i liked it again i do not have word for these feeling at the bottom of the article after i learned about the graphic detail of my own sexual assault the article listed his swimming time she wa found breathing unresponsive with her underwear six inch away from her bare stomach curled in fetal position by the way he s really good at swimming throw in my mile time if that s what we re doing i m good at cooking put that in there i think the end is where you list your extra curriculars to cancel out all the sickening thing that ve happened the night the news came out i sat my parent down and told them that i had been assaulted to not look at the news because it s upsetting just know that i m okay i m right here and i m okay but halfway through telling them my mom had to hold me because i could no longer stand up i wa not okay the night after it happened he said he didn t know my name said he wouldn t be able to identify my face in a lineup didn t mention any dialogue between u no word only dancing and kissing dancing is a cute term wa it snapping finger and twirling dancing or just body grinding up against each other in a crowded room i wonder if kissing wa just face sloppily pressed up against each other when the detective asked if he had planned on taking me back to his dorm he said no when the detective asked how we ended up behind the dumpster he said he didn t know he admitted to kissing other girl at that party one of whom wa my own sister who pushed him away he admitted to wanting to hook up with someone i wa the wounded antelope of the herd completely alone and vulnerable physically unable to fend for myself and he chose me sometimes i think if i hadn t gone then this never would ve happened but then i realized it would have happened just to somebody else you were about to enter four year of access to drunk girl and party and if this is the foot you started off on then it is right you did not continue the night after it happened he said he thought i liked it because i rubbed his back a back rub never mentioned me voicing consent never mentioned u speaking a back rub one more time in public news i learned that my as and vagina were completely exposed outside my breast had been groped finger had been jabbed inside me along with pine needle and debris my bare skin and head had been rubbing against the ground behind a dumpster while an erect freshman wa humping my half naked unconscious body but i don t remember so how do i prove i didn t like it i thought there s no way this is going to trial there were witness there wa dirt in my body he ran but wa caught he s going to settle formally apologize and we will both move on instead i wa told he hired a powerful attorney expert witness private investigator who were going to try and find detail about my personal life to use against me find loophole in my story to invalidate me and my sister in order to show that this sexual assault wa in fact a misunderstanding that he wa going to go to any length to convince the world he had simply been confused i wa not only told that i wa assaulted i wa told that because i couldn t remember i technically could not prove it wa unwanted and that distorted me damaged me almost broke me it is the saddest type of confusion to be told i wa assaulted and nearly raped blatantly out in the open but we don t know if it count a assault yet i had to fight for an entire year to make it clear that there wa something wrong with this situation when i wa told to be prepared in case we didn t win i said i can t prepare for that he wa guilty the minute i woke up no one can talk me out of the hurt he caused me worst of all i wa warned because he now know you don t remember he is going to get to write the script he can say whatever he want and no one can contest it i had no power i had no voice i wa defenseless my memory loss would be used against me my testimony wa weak wa incomplete and i wa made to believe that perhaps i am not enough to win this that s so damaging his attorney constantly reminded the jury the only one we can believe is brock because she doesn t remember that helplessness wa traumatizing instead of taking time to heal i wa taking time to recall the night in excruciating detail in order to prepare for the attorney s question that would be invasive aggressive and designed to steer me off course to contradict myself my sister phrased in way to manipulate my answer instead of his attorney saying did you notice any abrasion he said you didn t notice any abrasion right this wa a game of strategy a if i could be tricked out of my own worth the sexual assault had been so clear but instead here i wa at the trial answering question like how old are you how much do you weigh what did you eat that day well what did you have for dinner who made dinner did you drink with dinner no not even water when did you drink how much did you drink what container did you drink out of who gave you the drink how much do you usually drink who dropped you off at this party at what time but where exactly what were you wearing why were you going to this party what d you do when you got there are you sure you did that but what time did you do that what doe this text mean who were you texting when did you urinate where did you urinate with whom did you urinate outside wa your phone on silent when your sister called do you remember silencing it really because on page 53 i d like to point out that you said it wa set to ring did you drink in college you said you were a party animal how many time did you black out did you party at frat are you serious with your boyfriend are you sexually active with him when did you start dating would you ever cheat do you have a history of cheating what do you mean when you said you wanted to reward him do you remember what time you woke up were you wearing your cardigan what color wa your cardigan do you remember any more from that night no okay we ll let brock fill it in i wa pummeled with narrowed pointed question that dissected my personal life love life past life family life inane question accumulating trivial detail to try and find an excuse for this guy who didn t even take the time to ask me for my name who had me naked a handful of minute after seeing me after a physical assault i wa assaulted with question designed to attack me to say see her fact don t line up she s out of her mind she s practically an alcoholic she probably wanted to hook up he s like an athlete right they were both drunk whatever the hospital stuff she remembers is after the fact why take it into account brock ha a lot at stake so he s having a really hard time right now and then it came time for him to testify this is where i became revictimized i want to remind you the night after it happened he said he never planned to take me back to his dorm he said he didn t know why we were behind a dumpster he got up to leave because he wasn t feeling well when he wa suddenly chased and attacked then he learned i could not remember so one year later a predicted a new dialogue emerged brock had a strange new story almost sounded like a poorly written young adult novel with kissing and dancing and hand holding and lovingly tumbling onto the ground and most importantly in this new story there wa suddenly consent one year after the incident he remembered oh yeah by the way she actually said yes to everything so he said he had asked if i wanted to dance apparently i said yes he d asked if i wanted to go to his dorm i said yes then he asked if he could finger me and i said yes most guy don t ask can i finger you usually there s a natural progression of thing unfolding consensually not a q and a but apparently i granted full permission he s in the clear even in this story there s barely any dialogue i only said a total of three word before he had me half naked on the ground i have never been penetrated after three word he didn t claim to hear me speak one full sentence that night so in the news when it say we met i m not sure i would go so far a to say that future reference if you are confused about whether a girl can consent see if she can speak an entire sentence you couldn t even do that just one coherent string of word if she can t do that then no don t touch her just no not maybe just no where wa the confusion this is common sense human decency according to him the only reason we were on the ground wa because i fell down note if a girl fall help her get back up if she is too drunk to even walk and fall do not mount her hump her take off her underwear and insert your hand inside her vagina if a girl fall help her up if she is wearing a cardigan over her dress don t take it off so that you can touch her breast maybe she is cold maybe that s why she wore the cardigan if her bare as and leg are rubbing the pinecone and needle while the weight of you push into her get off her next in the story two people approached you you ran because you said you felt scared i argue that you were scared because you d be caught not because you were scared of two terrifying swedish grad student the idea that you thought you were being attacked out of the blue wa ludicrous that it had nothing to do with you being on top my unconscious body you were caught red handed with no explanation when they tackled you why didn t you say stop everything s okay go ask her she s right over there she ll tell you i mean you had just asked for my consent right i wa awake right when the policeman arrived and interviewed the evil swede who tackled you he wa cry so hard he couldn t speak because of what he d seen also if you really did think they were dangerous you just abandoned a half naked girl to run and save yourself no matter which way you frame it it doesn t make sense your attorney ha repeatedly pointed out well we don t know exactly when she became unconscious and you re right maybe i wa still fluttering my eye and wasn t completely limp yet fine his guilt did not depend on him knowing the exact second that i became unconscious that is never what this wa about i wa slurring too drunk to consent way before i wa on the ground i should have never been touched in the first place brock stated at no time did i see that she wa not responding if at any time i thought she wa not responding i would have stopped immediately here s the thing if your plan wa to stop only when i wa literally unresponsive then you still do not understand you didn t even stop when i wa unconscious anyway someone else stopped you two guy on bike noticed i wasn t moving in the dark and had to tackle you how did you not notice while on top of me you said you would have stopped and gotten help you say that but i want you to explain how you would ve helped me step by step walk me through this i want to know if those evil swede had not found me how the night would have played out i am asking you would you have pulled my underwear back on over my boot untangled the necklace wrapped around my neck closed my leg covered me tucked my bra back into my dress would you have helped me pick the needle from my hair asked if the abrasion on my neck and bottom hurt would you then go find a friend and say will you help me get her somewhere warm and soft i don t sleep when i think about the way it could have gone if the swede had never come what would have happened to me that s what you ll never have a good answer for that s what you can t explain even after a year to sit under oath and inform all of u that yes i wanted it yes i permitted it and that you are the true victim attacked by guy for reason unknown to you is sick is demented is selfish is stupid it show that you were willing to go to any length to discredit me invalidate me and explain why it wa okay to hurt me you tried unyieldingly to save yourself your reputation at my expense my family had to see picture of my head strapped to a gurney full of pine needle of my body in the dirt with my eye closed dress hiked up limb limp in the dark and then even after that my family had to listen to your attorney say the picture were after the fact we can dismiss them to say yes her nurse confirmed there wa redness and abrasion inside her but that s what happens when you finger someone and he s already admitted to that to listen to him use my own sister against me to listen him attempt to paint of a picture of me the seductive party animal a if somehow that would make it so that i had this coming for me to listen to him say i sounded drunk on the phone because i m silly and that s my goofy way of speaking to point out that in the voicemail i said i would reward my boyfriend and we all know what i wa thinking i assure you my reward program is non transferable especially to any nameless man that approach me the point is this is everything my family and i endured during the trial this is everything i had to sit through silently taking it while he shaped the evening it is enough to be suffering it is another thing to have someone ruthlessly working to diminish the gravity and validity of this suffering but in the end his unsupported statement and his attorney s twisted logic fooled no one the truth won the truth spoke for itself you are guilty twelve juror convicted you guilty of three felony count beyond reasonable doubt that s twelve vote per count thirty six yes confirming guilt that s one hundred percent unanimous guilt and i thought finally it is over finally he will own up to what he did truly apologize we will both move on and get better then i read your statement if you are hoping that one of my organ will implode from anger and i will die i m almost there you are very close assault is not an accident this is not a story of another drunk college hookup with poor decision making somehow you still don t get it somehow you still sound confused i will now take this opportunity to read portion of the defendant s statement and respond to them you said being drunk i just couldn t make the best decision and neither could she alcohol is not an excuse is it a factor yes but alcohol wa not the one who stripped me fingered me had my head dragging against the ground with me almost fully naked having too much to drink wa an amateur mistake that i admit to but it is not criminal everyone in this room ha had a night where they have regretted drinking too much or know someone close to them who ha had a night where they have regretted drinking too much regretting drinking is not the same a regretting sexual assault we were both drunk the difference is i did not take off your pant and underwear touch you inappropriately and run away that s the difference you said if i wanted to get to know her i should have asked for her number rather than asking her to go back to my room i m not mad because you didn t ask for my number even if you did know me i would not want to be in this situation my own boyfriend know me but if he asked to finger me behind a dumpster i would slap him no girl want to be in this situation nobody i don t care if you know their phone number or not you said i stupidly thought it wa okay for me to do what everyone around me wa doing which wa drinking i wa wrong again you were not wrong for drinking everyone around you wa not sexually assaulting me you were wrong for doing what nobody else wa doing which wa pushing your erect dick in your pant against my naked defenseless body concealed in a dark area where partygoer could no longer see or protect me and own my sister could not find me sipping fireball is not your crime peeling off and discarding my underwear like a candy wrapper to insert your finger into my body is where you went wrong why am i still explaining this you said during the trial i didn t want to victimize her at all that wa just my attorney and his way of approaching the case your attorney is not your scapegoat he represents you did your attorney say some incredulously infuriating degrading thing absolutely he said you had an erection because it wa cold i have no word you said you are in the process of establishing a program for high school and college student in which you speak about your experience to speak out against the college campus drinking culture and the sexual promiscuity that go along with that speak out against campus drinking culture that s what we re speaking out against you think that s what i ve spent the past year fighting for not awareness about campus sexual assault or rape or learning to recognize consent campus drinking culture down with jack daniel down with skyy vodka if you want talk to high school kid about drinking go to an aa meeting you realize having a drinking problem is different than drinking and then forcefully trying to have sex with someone show men how to respect woman not how to drink le drinking culture and the sexual promiscuity that go along with that go along with that like a side effect like fry on the side of your order where doe promiscuity even come into play i don t see headline that read brock turner guilty of drinking too much and the sexual promiscuity that go along with that campus sexual assault there s your first powerpoint slide i have done enough explaining you do not get to shrug your shoulder and be confused anymore you do not get to pretend that there were no red flag you do not get to not know why you ran you have been convicted of violating me with malicious intent and all you can admit to is consuming alcohol do not talk about the sad way your life wa upturned because alcohol made you do bad thing figure out how to take responsibility for your own conduct lastly you said i want to show people that one night of drinking can ruin a life ruin a life one life yours you forgot about mine let me rephrase for you i want to show people that one night of drinking can ruin two life you and me you are the cause i am the effect you have dragged me through this hell with you dipped me back into that night again and again you knocked down both our tower i collapsed at the same time you did your damage wa concrete stripped of title degree enrollment my damage wa internal unseen i carry it with me you took away my worth my privacy my energy my time my safety my intimacy my confidence my own voice until today see one thing we have in common is that we were both unable to get up in the morning i am no stranger to suffering you made me a victim in newspaper my name wa unconscious intoxicated woman ten syllable and nothing more than that for a while i believed that that wa all i wa i had to force myself to relearn my real name my identity to relearn that this is not all that i am that i am not just a drunk victim at a frat party found behind a dumpster while you are the all american swimmer at a top university innocent until proven guilty with so much at stake i am a human being who ha been irreversibly hurt who waited a year to figure out if i wa worth something my independence natural joy gentleness and steady lifestyle i had been enjoying became distorted beyond recognition i became closed off angry self deprecating tired irritable empty the isolation at time wa unbearable you cannot give me back the life i had before that night either while you worry about your shattered reputation i refrigerated spoon every night so when i woke up and my eye were puffy from cry i would hold the spoon to my eye to lessen the swelling so that i could see i showed up an hour late to work every morning excused myself to cry in the stairwell i can tell you all the best place in that building to cry where no one can hear you the pain became so bad that i had to tell my bos i wa leaving i needed time because continuing day to day wa not possible i used my saving to go a far away a i could possibly be i can t sleep alone at night without having a light on like a five year old because i have nightmare of being touched where i cannot wake up i did this thing where i waited until the sun came up and i felt safe enough to sleep for three month i went to bed at six o clock in the morning i used to pride myself on my independence now i am afraid to go on walk in the evening to attend social event with drinking among friend where i should be comfortable being i have become a little barnacle always needing to be at someone s side to have my boyfriend standing next to me sleeping beside me protecting me it is embarrassing how feeble i feel how timidly i move through life always guarded ready to defend myself ready to be angry you have no idea how hard i have worked to rebuild part of me that are still weak it took me eight month to even talk about what happened i could no longer connect with friend with everyone around me i would scream at my boyfriend my own family whenever they brought this up you never let me forget what happened to me at the of end of the hearing the trial i wa too tired to speak i would leave drained silent i would go home turn off my phone and for day i would not speak you bought me a ticket to a planet where i lived by myself every time a new article would come out i lived with the paranoia that my entire hometown would find out and know me a the girl who got assaulted i didn t want anyone s pity and am still learning to accept victim a part of my identity you made my own hometown an uncomfortable place to be someday you can pay me back for my ambulance ride and therapy but you cannot give me back my sleepless night the way i have broken down sobbing uncontrollably if i m watching a movie and a woman is harmed to say it lightly this experience ha expanded my empathy for other victim i have lost weight from stress when people would comment i told them i ve been running a lot lately there are time i did not want to be touched i have to relearn that i am not fragile i am capable i am wholesome not just livid and weak i want to say this all the cry the hurting you have imposed on me i can take it but when i see my younger sister hurting when she is unable to keep up in school when she is deprived of joy when she is not sleeping when she is cry so hard on the phone she is barely breathing telling me over and over she is sorry for leaving me alone that night sorry sorry sorry when she feel more guilt than you then i do not forgive you that night i had called her to try and find her but you found me first your attorney s closing statement began my sister said she wa fine and who know her better than her sister you tried to use my own sister against me your point of attack were so weak so low it wa almost embarrassing you do not touch her if you think i wa spared came out unscathed that today i ride off into sunset while you suffer the greatest blow you are mistaken nobody win we have all been devastated we have all been trying to find some meaning in all of this suffering you should have never done this to me secondly you should have never made me fight so long to tell you you should have never done this to me but here we are the damage is done no one can undo it and now we both have a choice we can let this destroy u i can remain angry and hurt and you can be in denial or we can face it head on i accept the pain you accept the punishment and we move on your life is not over you have decade of year ahead

so i challenge you to make a new name for yourself to do something so good for the world it blow everyone away you have a brain and a voice and a heart use them wisely you posse immense love from your family that alone can pull you out of anything mine ha held me up through all of this yours will hold you and you will go on i believe that one day you will understand all of this better i hope you will become a better more honest person who can properly use this story to prevent another story like this from ever happening again i fully support your journey to healing to rebuilding your life because that is the only way you ll begin to help others now to address the sentencing when i read the probation officer s report i wa in disbelief consumed by anger which eventually quieted down to profound sadness my statement have been slimmed down to distortion and taken out of context i fought hard during this trial and will not have the outcome minimized by a probation officer who attempted to evaluate my current state and my wish in a fifteen minute conversation the majority of which wa spent answering question i had about the legal system the context is also important brock had yet to issue a statement and i had not read his remark my life ha been on hold for over a year a year of anger anguish and uncertainty until a jury of my peer rendered a judgment that validated the injustice i had endured had brock admitted guilt and remorse and offered to settle early on i would have considered a lighter sentence respecting his honesty grateful to be able to move our life forward instead he took the risk of going to trial added insult to injury and forced me to relive the hurt a detail about my personal life and sexual assault were brutally dissected before the public he pushed me and my family through a year of inexplicable unnecessary suffering and should face the consequence of challenging his crime of putting my pain into question of making u wait so long for justice i told the probation officer i do not want brock to rot away in prison i did not say he doe not deserve to be behind bar the probation officer s recommendation of a year or le in county jail is a soft time out a mockery of the seriousness of his assault and of the consequence of the pain i have been forced to endure i also told the probation officer that what i truly wanted wa for brock to get it to understand and admit to his wrongdoing unfortunately after reading the defendant s statement i am severely disappointed and feel that he ha failed to exhibit sincere remorse or responsibility for his conduct i fully respected his right to a trial but even after twelve juror unanimously convicted him guilty of three felony all he ha admitted to doing is ingesting alcohol someone who cannot take full accountability for his action doe not deserve a mitigating sentence it is deeply offensive that he would try and dilute rape with a suggestion of promiscuity by definition rape is the absence of promiscuity rape is the absence of consent and it perturbs me deeply that he can t even see that distinction the probation officer factored in that the defendant is youthful and ha no prior conviction in my opinion he is old enough to know what he did wa wrong when you are eighteen in this country you can go to war when you are nineteen you are old enough to pay the consequence for attempting to rape someone he is young but he is old enough to know better a this is a first offense i can see where leniency would beckon on the other hand a a society we cannot forgive everyone s first sexual assault or digital rape it doesn t make sense the seriousness of rape ha to be communicated clearly we should not create a culture that suggests we learn that rape is wrong through trial and error the consequence of sexual assault need to be severe enough that people feel enough fear to exercise good judgment even if they are drunk severe enough to be preventative the fact that brock wa a star athlete at a prestigious university should not be seen a an entitlement to leniency but a an opportunity to send a strong cultural message that sexual assault is against the law regardless of social class the probation officer weighed the fact that he ha surrendered a hard earned swimming scholarship if i had been sexually assaulted by an un athletic guy from a community college what would his sentence be if a first time offender from an underprivileged background wa accused of three felony and displayed no accountability for his action other than drinking what would his sentence be how fast he swim doe not lessen the impact of what happened to me the probation officer ha stated that this case when compared to other crime of similar nature may be considered le serious due to the defendant s level of intoxication it felt serious that s all i m going to say he is a lifetime sex registrant that doesn t expire just like what he did to me doesn t expire doesn t just go away after a set number of year it stay with me it s part of my identity it ha forever changed the way i carry myself the way i live the rest of my life a year ha gone by and he ha had lot of time on his hand ha he been seeing a psychologist what ha he done in this past year to show he s been progressing if he say he want to implement program what ha he done to show for it throughout incarceration i hope he is provided with appropriate therapy and resource to rebuild his life i request that he educates himself about the issue of campus sexual assault i hope he accepts proper punishment and push himself

not everyone want to suffer through 60 hour work week long commute obnoxious paperwork to navigate arbitrary corporate hierarchy and the blase confines of an infinite cubicle hell people want to be rich without the risk without the sacrifice without the delayed gratification necessary to accumulate wealth everybody want to have great sex and an awesome relationship but not everyone is willing to go through the tough conversation the awkward silence the hurt feeling and the emotional psychodrama to get there and so they settle they settle and wonder what if for year and year and until the question morphs from what if into wa that it and when the lawyer go home and the alimony check is in the mail they say what wa that for if not for their lowered standard and expectation 20 year prior then what for because happiness requires struggle the positive is the side effect of handling the negative you can only avoid negative experience for so long before they come roaring back to life at the core of all human behavior our need are more or le similar positive experience is easy to handle it s negative experience that we all by definition struggle with therefore what we get out of life is not determined by the good feeling we desire but by what bad feeling we re willing and able to sustain to get u to those good feeling people want an amazing physique but you don t end up with one unless you legitimately appreciate the pain and physical stress that come with living inside a gym for hour upon hour unless you love calculating and calibrating the food you eat planning your life out in tiny plate sized portion people want to start their own business or become financially independent but you don t end up a successful entrepreneur unless you find a way to appreciate the risk the uncertainty the repeated failure and working insane hour on something you have no idea whether will be successful or not people want a partner a spouse but you don t end up attracting someone amazing without appreciating the emotional turbulence that come with weathering rejection building the sexual tension that never get released and staring blankly at a phone that never ring it s part of the game of love you can t win if you don t play what determines your success isn t what do you want to enjoy the question is what pain do you want to sustain the quality of your life is not determined by the quality of your positive experience but the quality of your negative experience and to get good at dealing with negative experience is to get good at dealing with life there s a lot of crappy advice out there that say you ve just got to want it enough everybody want something and everybody want something enough they just aren t aware of what it is they want or rather what they want enough because if you want the benefit of something in life you have to also want the cost if you want the beach body you have to want the sweat the soreness the early morning and the hunger pang if you want the yacht you have to also want the late night the risky business move and the possibility of pissing off a person or ten thousand if you find yourself wanting something month after month year after year yet nothing happens and you never come any closer to it then maybe what you actually want is a fantasy an idealization an image and a false promise maybe what you want isn t what you want you just enjoy wanting maybe you don t actually want it at all sometimes i ask people how do you choose to suffer these people tilt their head and look at me like i have twelve nose but i ask because that tell me far more about you than your desire and fantasy because you have to choose something you can t have a pain free life it can t all be rose and unicorn and ultimately that s the hard question that matter pleasure is an easy question and pretty much all of u have similar answer the more interesting question is the pain what is the pain that you want to sustain that answer will actually get you somewhere it s the question that can change your life it s what make me me and you you it s what defines u and separate u and ultimately brings u together for most of my adolescence and young adulthood i fantasized about being a musician a rock star in particular any badass guitar song i heard i would always close my eye and envision myself up on stage playing it to the scream of the crowd people absolutely losing their mind to my sweet finger noodling this fantasy could keep me occupied for hour on end the fantasizing continued up through college even after i dropped out of music school and stopped playing seriously but even then it wa never a question of if i d ever be up playing in front of screaming crowd but when i wa biding my time before i could invest the proper amount of time and effort into getting out there and making it work first i needed to finish school then i needed to make money then i needed to find the time then and then nothing despite fantasizing about this for over half of my life the reality never came and it took me a long time and a lot of negative experience to finally figure out why i didn t actually want it i wa in love with the result the image of me on stage people cheering me rocking out pouring my heart into what i m playing but i wasn t in love with the process and because of that i failed at it repeatedly hell i didn t even try hard enough to fail at it i hardly tried at all the daily drudgery of practicing the logistics of finding a group and rehearsing the pain of finding gig and actually getting people to show up and give a shit the broken string the blown tube amp hauling 40 pound of gear to and from rehearsal with no car it s a mountain of a dream and a mile high climb to the top and what it took me a long time to discover is that i didn t like to climb much i just liked to imagine the top our culture would tell me that i ve somehow failed myself that i m a quitter or a loser self help would say that i either wasn t courageous enough determined enough or i didn t believe in myself enough the entrepreneurial start up crowd would tell me that i chickened out on my dream and gave in to my conventional social conditioning i d be told to do affirmation or join a mastermind group or manifest or something but the truth is far le interesting than that i thought i wanted something but it turn out i didn t end of story i wanted the reward and not the struggle i wanted the result and not the process i wa in love not with the fight but only the victory and life doesn t work that way who you are is defined by the value you are willing to struggle for people who enjoy the struggle of a gym are the one who get in good shape people who enjoy long workweek and the politics of the corporate ladder are the one who move up it people who enjoy the stress and uncertainty of the starving artist lifestyle are ultimately the one who live it and make it this is not a call for willpower or grit this is

fair number are used to connect one idea to another perhaps meaning something like following up or a something like a spoken semi colon still other example use the slash a a way to indicate truth

having hallucination slash someone is playing trick on me doesn t seem like english at all doe it these day many english speaker would disagree curzan explicitly noted that the slash can now be used to connect full clause the most interesting implication to me she said is that this coordinator is expanding in use and taking on new meaning usage guideline are of course still very restrictive in

series of awkwardly short bullet point sentence however strange i m going for a run slash walk in the park sound to your ear it get across the same basic message a the much wordier alternative i m going to run in the park but probably do a fair amount of walking too because running is hard using slash assigned more truth value to walk over run the slash give u a perfect opportunity to say two

it would be best if we don t play at all said ivan perisic who scored the opening goal for croatia maybe that would actually be better in case these thing are going to happen every time we play the

dell owned gaming pc manufacturer alienware and nelson gonzalez alienware s cofounder and former ceo to discus what they have learned about vr and where they believe it s headed below are the key highlight from our conversation virtual reality will get more physical anyone who s seen or tried the htc vive know that some physical activity is involved the vive and it two controller are equipped with sensor that allow player to swing a virtual golf club or wield an imaginary paintbrush but what system like the vive or playstation vr currently lack is a sense of touch although it may look like you re swinging a golf club the device in your hand still feel like a video game controller the oculus rift doesn t yet support any motion controller although the company plan to launch such device later in 2016 this is going to be one of the first area in which virtual reality will improve say gonzalez the next evolution of vr would be where you participate physically in that vr world gonzalez

building technology for interacting with vr environment without a controller startup thalmic lab also make an armband capable of controlling electronic device through gesture that work with the rift vr is an industry wide effort the oculus rift will likely be remembered a the first modern virtual reality headset but it take more than just one device to impact the industry in a meaningful way say azor azor draw comparison to the way the gaming industry developed over the past decade pc became better equipped to deliver high end gaming experience a company like intel amd and nvidia developed more powerful chip and graphic processor game became more accessible on pc a company like steam created platform for easily buying and browsing content everyone rallied around the pc gaming industry and now we have what we have today he said vr is the same type of thing no one company can solve all of the problem a wireless rift or vive won t happen soon there are two class of virtual reality device available today cheaper portable device like the samsung gear vr and google cardboard and beefier expensive system that offer more immersive experience like the rift and the vive the former plug into your smartphone to deliver vr that s wireless and convenient while the latter must be tethered to a pc to power their higher end performance it s unlikely that we ll see a high performance

which wa the decision to build much of the plane out of carbon fiber reinforced plastic and other composite material instead of the aluminum most commonly used on commercial airliner while the engineering of the composite airframe may have been a challenge it s a decision that allowed boeing to make a major change to it aircraft that could greatly reduce the effect of jet lag on it passenger the dreamliner ha a composite fuselage and that allowed u to pressurize it at whatever altitude we wanted because the material is not a susceptible to fatigue blake emery director of differentiation strategy for boeing commercial airplane told business insider in an interview currently most airliner have cabin air pressure equivalent to that of an altitude of 8 000 foot for the dreamliner boeing cut that down to 6 000 foot to lower the cabin altitude we actually increased the air pressure inside the cabin emery added it s a bit counterintuitive for most people why doe air pressure matter to passenger for most of u a long flight is usually followed by some combination of symptom that include headache lack of appetite lack of energy nausea and sleeplessness all of these affliction have been conveniently bundled together with a disruption of one s internal body clock to form something we call jet lag but the reality is that jet lag is far more serious the very symptom we attribute to jet lag may actually be attributed to acute mountain sickness which affect individual exposed to altitude above 6 500 foot in a study conducted by oklahoma state university with the help of boeing researcher wrote some passenger on long commercial flight experience discomfort characterized by symptom similar to those of acute mountain sickness the symptom are often attributed to factor such a jet lag prolonged sitting dehydration or contamination of cabin air however because barometric pressure in aircraft cabin are similar to those at the terrestrial altitude at which acute mountain sickness occurs it is possible that some of the symptom are related to the decreased partial pressure of oxygen and are manifestation of acute mountain sickness in 2015 boeing annouced it had made the lightest metal ever the study found that passenger who go from sea level up to 8 000 foot of altitude saw the oxygen content in their blood fall 4 although this didn t trigger full on acute mountain sickness it did bring on what the study called increased prevalence of discomfort after three to nine hour of exposure the research showed passenger body reacted at 6 000 foot similar to that at sea level emery said so we decided to pressurize the dreamliner at 6 000 foot at 6 000 foot the cabin air is more dense and ha a greater level of oxygen saturation a result the body doe not have to work a hard to oxygenate blood and sustain itself according to emery since there isn t a perfect one to one correlation between altitude and jet lag boeing ha taken additional measure to mitigate the symptom these measure include an increase in cabin humidity a well a a new air filtration system why haven t we had this all along the dreamliner won t be the only boeing jet to have a have a lower cabin altitude the company s upcoming 777x wide body mini jumbo jet will also be pressurized at 6 000 foot however unlike the composite dreamliner the 777x boeing s successor to landmark 777 will be primarily made of aluminum aluminum aircraft can be pressurized to 6 000 foot kent craver boeing commercial airplane regional director of passenger satisfaction told business insider in an interview in fact most business jet are already pressurized to that level in addition airbus is also working to lower the cabin altitude on it next generation of airliner airplane maker have traditionally avoided lowering the cabin altitude because boosting the air pressure inside the cabin put greater stress on aluminum airframe this increase the likelihood of metal fatigue and shortens the service life of the airplane however boeing belief it can successfully lower cabin altitude on the 777x without going to a composite body we know the 777 fuselage it structural quality and it fatigue margin really well a boeing spokesperson told u in an email we also understand the requirement of the lower cabin altitude in term of cycle and pressure on the fuselage a a result we can achieve it with a

have anything to do a he looked for a new endeavor before he decided to buy the clipper his wife connie encouraged him to help with some of her philanthropic effort an idea he initially rejected but come on doesn t the government take care of the poor the sick the old mr ballmer recalled telling her after all he pointed out he happily paid a lot of tax and he figured that all that tax money should create a sufficient social safety net her answer a it won t because there are thing government doesn t get to and b you re missing it mr ballmer replied no i m not that conversation led mr ballmer to pursue what may be one of the most ambitious private project undertaken to answer a question that ha long vexed the public and politician alike he sought to figure out what the government really doe with the money mr ballmer said what really happens on tuesday mr ballmer plan to make public a database and a report that he and a small army of economist professor and other professional have been assembling a part of a stealth start up over the last three year called usafacts the database is perhaps the first nonpartisan effort to create a fully integrated look at revenue and spending across federal state and local government want to know how many police officer are employed in various part of the country and compare that against crime rate want to know how much revenue is brought in from parking ticket and the cost to collect want to know what percentage of american suffer from diagnosed depression and how much the government spends on it that s in there you can slice the number in all sort of way mr ballmer call it the equivalent of a 10 k for government referring to the kind of annual filing that company make you know when i really wanted to understand in depth what a company wa doing amazon or apple i d get their 10 k and read it he told me in a recent interview in new york it s wonky it s this it s that but it s the greatest depth you re going to get and it s accurate in an age of fake news and question about how politician and others manipulate data to fit their bias mr ballmer s project may serve a a powerful antidote using his website usafacts org

made during public policy debate at the dinner table i would like citizen to be able to use this to form intelligent opinion mr ballmer said people can disagree about what to do i m not going to tell people what to do but he said people ought to base their opinion on common data set that are believable so how exactly doe one go about collecting and ordering the nation s data before he started mr ballmer wa convinced someone must have already done this his first instinct naturally wa to go to a search engine my favorite one of course i go to bing he said and by the way i check it with google just to make sure there s nothing i m missing but neither option led him to what he wa looking for you ve got to look at federal state and local together mr ballmer said because i m a citizen i don t care whether i give my money to a b or c i just want to know how it land how it impact what s going on with an unlimited budget he went about hiring a team of researcher in seattle and made a grant to the university of pennsylvania to help his staff put the information together altogether he ha spent more than 10 million between direct funding and grant let s say it cost three four five million a year he said i m happy to fund the damn thing for mr ballmer the experience ha been worth every cent simply for the surprise that he ha discovered looking at the data i love this one he said showing me a slide of information about government employee don t look don t look he instructed me to cover my eye from the number at the bottom of the page how many people work for government in the united state he asked with the excitement of a child showing off a new toy before displaying the answer almost 24 million would you have guessed that then people say those damn bureaucrat mr ballmer

didn t realize all these not for profit were in a sense almost like government contractor mr ballmer said he wanted the project to be completely apolitical he ha given money to candidate on both side

hundred buck a year i wa a little surprised by that you can have your own reaction i wa a little surprised by that one rule mr ballmer said his team made early on wa to use only government data no

nerve wracking despite hillary clinton s large margin in miami dade county and broward county trump ran up the score elsewhere in the state from the deep south panhandle to the interior of florida to peninsula s southwest a bastion of working class white and retiree from the midwest who pushed him over the top trump ran up huge margin with white florida voter who comprise 64 percent of the state s voting roll and have always been the most reliable voter in term of turnout latino turnout in miami dade and orange county wa just not enough for clinton the ups and down of the campaign had gnawed at

disproportionately cast absentee ballot by mail in early october a hurricane matthew left part of the state damaged wile realized the campaign had mistakenly not run an absentee ballot program at all she sounded the alarm and trump made sure the money wa reprogrammed two week ago during a meeting at trump s golf club in doral source said wile successfully made the case to trump to spend more on mail advertising and paid caller to reach out to more republican absentee ballot voter wile who managed gov rick scott s first campaign in 2010 would neither confirm nor deny the account the spending wa noteworthy because trump notoriously tight fisted with campaign money believed that campaign dropped too much money on tv and get out the vote ground game effort instead trump had his outsized personality his knowledge of florida his second home where he owns the palm beach mar a lago estate and his plane that could carry him to any spot on a moment s notice in florida where thousand of supporter materialized for his rally seemingly spontaneously but even with all of the new trump spending hillary clinton s campaign began to surge black and hispanic voter cast record number of absentee ballot and flocked to the early voting poll by tuesday morning democrat felt confident they could ride out the wave of what they knew would be a surge of republican voter who tend to vote in greater force on election day about 1 p m one source with clinton s campaign said the democrat were worried republican were crushing the vote in the panhandle southwest florida and smaller conservative leaning county by 5 p m our voter showed again the source not authorized to speak by the campaign said we felt pretty good the size of the vote wa historic in populous democratic stronghold like broward miami dade and palm beach county but turnout wa even higher in republican area by the end of the night trump s lead wa so big that even if turnout in florida wa modeled at 80 percent far higher than recent election clinton would still not win if she beat trump by double digit clinton s campaign wa almost reduced to a regional effort confined to the southeastern peninsula she won a stunning 571 000 more vote than trump in the miami fort lauderdale medium market one of ten in the state according to state election data posted after midnight she won three lesser market

pollster tony fabrizio said the result showed that clinton exceeded president obama s margin in the florida market he won in 2012 but obama only carried florida by le than a point the difference here is that trump did far better than mitt romney did in almost every county on election day fabrizio said trump began election day down by at least 57 000 vote to clinton according to result posted on the florida division of election website just after the last florida poll closed at 7 p m central time but after that a election day vote poured in trump began building a margin that stretched to more than 100 000 by 8 30 p m by 9 10 p m trump s margin started to peak at just under 150 000 vote over clinton it started to trend down but not fast enough for the liking of democrat who just two hour before were musing about how trump had lost florida and therefore the white house so go florida so go the country said florida s senior senator bill nelson look at the hispanic turning out often the hispanic are registered no party affiliation but the young hispanic they ll be voting for hillary nelson and other democrat also expected clinton to pad her margin with african american support but while clinton rolled up vote with non white voter white voter appeared to heavily trend toward trump and white are still a majority of florida s voter roll 64 percent by registration and they vote in even greater number their outsized support counteracted the vote of hispanic and black 16 percent and 13 percent of the voter roll respectively trump s strong showing call into question those who believed his inflammatory comment about immigration reform would ultimately cost him florida trump s position put him at loggerhead with the spanish language powerhouse network univision which ha

population in the country and poll after poll showed that the older the voter the more they liked trump most major survey also showed trump losing the state including exit poll on election day this wa a data defying feat that captured a populist fervor we just couldn t measure said one republican pollster who wa surprised by trump s number the trump campaign kept talking about the missing white voter well they showed up on election day in myriad way trump succeeded despite the conventional wisdom trump s campaign initially didn t run a robust absentee ballot program to get voter to fill out and mail back their vote he delayed advertising on television a must for any other statewide candidate and he refused at time to soften his tone on immigration trump didn t run a robust program in south florida targeting the hispanic community you could make an argument that his past statement about immigration and illegal immigrant made it impossible said curt anderson top adviser to gov scott the chair of the pro trump super pac but when gov scott won he did so because he really reached out if trump had we wouldn t be talking right now he would have florida in the bag maybe he ll win because of what s in the countryside so to speak or the panhandle but this is really doing it the hard way the florida meltdown is a familiar story for democrat still scarred by al gore s 2000 loss to george w bush in a razor close race though obama won the state twice both time were by narrow margin built on the strength of his appeal to minority voter in the state but the vaunted obama machine in florida wa no machine without obama on the ticket now democrat face a bleak prospect of the coming midterm election when liberal leaning voter tend to stay away from the poll while republican keep voting sen nelson s team fear a showdown with scott who ha won twice based on the strength of white voter and an outsider message clinton ally expressed increasing optimism about their chance in the state heading into election day energized by early vote result that showed hispanic turnout exploding exit poll reinforced that optimism showing clinton with a narrow lead and demographic trend pointing her way trump s strength wa no surprise to republican party of florida chairman blaise ingoglia who earlier in the day said republican had more energized voter who couldn t wait until

14 2018 at age 76 this story originally published on his 70th birthday on january 7 2012 is being resurfaced to explain how he beat the odds and lived so long with the disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis al stephen hawking turn 70 on sunday beating the odds of a daunting diagnosis by nearly half a century the famous theoretical physicist ha helped to bring his idea about black hole and quantum gravity to a broad public audience for much of his time in the public eye though he ha been confined to a wheelchair by a form of the motor neuron disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis al and since 1985 he ha had to speak through his trademark computer system which he operates with his cheek and have around the clock care but his disease seems hardly to have slowed him down hawking spent 30 year a a full professor of mathematics at the university of cambridge and he is currently the director of research at the school s center for theoretical cosmology but like his mind hawking s illness seems to be singular most patient with al also known a lou gehrig s disease for the famous baseball player who succumbed to the disease are diagnosed after the age of 50 and die within five year of their diagnosis hawking s condition wa first diagnosed when he wa 21 and he wa not expected to see his 25th birthday why ha hawking lived so long with this malady when so many other people die so soon after diagnosis we spoke with leo mccluskey an associate professor of neurology and medical director of the al center at the university of pennsylvania to find out more about the disease and why it ha spared hawking and his amazing brain what is al and is there more than one form of it al which is also known a a motor neuron disease and colloquially a lou gehrig s disease in the u s is a neurodegenerative disease each muscle is controlled by motor neuron that reside in the brain in the frontal lobe these are controlled electrically and are synaptically connected to motor neuron that reside lower down in the brain a well a motor neuron that reside in the spinal cord the guy in the brain are called the upper motor neuron and the guy in the spine are called the lower motor neuron the disease cause weakness of either upper motor neuron or lower motor neuron or both it s been known for quite some time that there are variant of al one is referred to a progressive muscular atrophy or pma it appears to be an isolated illness of the lower motor neuron however pathologically if you do an autopsy of a patient they will have evidence of deterioration of upper motor neuron there is also primary lateral sclerosis pls and clinically it look like an isolated upper motor neuron disorder however pathologically they also have lower motor neuron disorder the other classic syndrome is called progressive baldor palsy or progressive supranuclear palsy which is weakening of cranial muscle like the tongue face and swallowing muscle but it pretty much always spread to limb muscle those are the four classic motor neuron disorder that have been described and it wa thought for quite some time that these disorder were limited to motor neuron it s now clear that that s not true it s now well recognized that 10 percent of these patient can develop degeneration in another part of the brain such a other part of the frontal lobe that don t contain the motor neuron or the temporal lobe so some of these patient can actually develop dementia called frontal temporal lobe dementia one of the misconception about al is that it s only a motor neuron disease and that s not true what ha stephen hawking s case shown about the disease one thing that is highlighted by this man s course is that this is an incredibly variable disorder in many way on average people live two to three year after diagnosis but that mean that half the people live longer and there are people who live for a long long time life expectancy turn on two thing the motor neuron running the diaphragm the breathing muscle so the common way people die is of respiratory failure and the other thing is the deterioration of swallowing muscle and that can lead to malnutrition and dehydration if you don t have these two thing you could potentially live for a long time even though you re getting worse what s happened to him is just astounding he s certainly an outlier ha he lived so long because he got the disease when he wa young and had the juvenile onset type juvenile onset is diagnosed in the teenage year and i don t know enough about his course to say but it s probably something similar to juvenile onset disorder which is something that progress very very very slowly i have patient in my clinic who were diagnosed in their teen and are still alive in their 40 50 or 60 but not having ever examined him or taken a history it s a little hard for me to say he s a very good example of the sparing of the non motor part of the brain that can occur how frequent are these case of very slow progressing form of al i would say probably le than a few percent how much do you think stephen hawking s longevity ha been due to the excellent care that he ha received versus the biology of his particular form of al it s probably a little bit of both i just know him from television so i don t know what kind of intervention he s had if he really isn t on a ventilator then it s his biology it s the biology of his form of the neurodegenerative disease that determines how long he will live for trouble swallowing you can elect to have a feeding tube placed which basically take malnutrition and dehydration off the table but mostly it s about the biology of the disease hawking obviously ha quite the active mind and previous statement that he ha made seem to indicate he ha a pretty positive mental outlook despite his condition is there any evidence that lifestyle and psychological well being do much to help with patient outcome or is the disease usually too quick for that to make a difference i don t believe that add to longevity al still doesn t have a cure what have we learned about the disease recently that might help u find one or at least better treatment beginning in 2006 it became clear that like a lot of other neurodegenerative disease al wa determined by the accumulation of abnormal protein in the brain ten percent of al is genetic and based on a gene mutation i m sure there are also at risk gene for al but there are now multiple gene that have been identified a potentially causing the disease each one of them are interesting in that they lead to the accumulation of different protein in the brain knowing specific gene give u particular mechanism in the brain and would potentially give u target for therapy but none of this ha given u any robust therapy yet what doe stephen hawking s case mean for people who have the disease it s just an incredible incredible example of the variability of the disease and the hope for patient who have it that they could also live a long life

addition to wreaking havoc with sleep disruption to circadian rhythm also have been associated with a number of serious disease including cancer diabetes depression and heart disease in particular research in recent year ha shown that blue wavelength light is especially harmful to circadian rhythm function study have shown that blue wavelength light ha uniquely harmful effect on human and suppresses melatonin level more vigorously than other light wavelength unfortunately many energy efficient light source produce high concentration of blue light blue light is emitted by electronic device energy efficient light bulb and other common light source research investigating blue light blocking most often in the form of goggles that filter out this particular wavelength of light ha shown promise a new study of cataract patient indicates that artificial lens implant can help improve sleep scientist at china s sichuan university studied the effect of blue light blocking artificial lens implanted during cataract surgery the study involved 40 patient who required surgery for cataract in both eye cataract surgery commonly involves removal of the eye s damaged lens and insertion of an artificial lens cataract are a common condition among older adult approximately 60 percent of people over the age of 60 experience cataract the study subject 26 woman and 14 men with an average age of 74 were given artificial lens with blue light blocking capability researcher assessed patient sleep quality before surgery and again two month after surgery they found patient sleep had improved

subject who met the criterion for poor sleeper had decreased lens replacement surgery is necessary for cataract patient but there are other le invasive way to filter out blue light that are also being investigated by sleep scientist research ha shown the benefit to sleep of manipulating and controlling exposure to blue light a study of 20 adult who wore either blue light blocking or ultraviolet

exposure to blue wavelength light is damaging to circadian rhythm exposure to blue light isn t always detrimental daytime exposure to blue light can stimulate alertness and help sleep later on a study of 94 office worker found that daytime exposure to blue light during work hour resulted in improvement both to sleep and to daytime functioning compared to exposure to white light subject who were exposed to blue light experienced improvement to daytime alertness mood and concentration these subject also experienced decrease in daytime sleepiness and they slept better at night this area of

tablet to read bring the screen s brightness level down make the last 60 minute of your bedtime ritual electronics free and keep electronic gadget and device out of the bedroom altogether get light exposure during the day daytime exposure to light both sunlight and artificial light can help strengthen circadian rhythm and boost daytime alertness leaving you better prepared to sleep when the time come if you need access to light in the middle of the night use small nightlights rather than switching on hallway or bathroom light and flooding your system with melatonin suppressing light use low

didn t really look like like his family member or like any raccoon james had ever seen this trashmonger wa an albino raccoon an incredibly rare specimen according to the indiana division of fish and wildlife how rare exactly the organization stated only one in 750 000 raccoon inherit the albino gene a mutation that mean the animal creates no melanin and therefore ha no pigmentation stunned by his find james didn t forget the real trouble at hand these raccoon were stuck thinking quickly james fabricated a little something to help the raccoon escape their trash pit prison a wood plank he leaned it on the inside of the dumpster and the raccoon could use it like a ramp they were free but that brought consequence the albino raccoon had been a well kept secret in coonskin park according to rodney jones chief of kanawha s park police department and once james shared his picture online officer jones feared it would become the subject of the public s curious camera now that the albino s getting publicity rodney said i figure people will start looking to see if they can find it around the park and people searching for a wild animal with a wild animal s instinct can be trouble we try to tell people with animal to keep their distance and don t try to feed them he said after emphasizing that raccoon carry deadly disease i d really hate to see an animal like that be destroyed because of someone s curiosity or stupidity worse the albino raccoon s appearance can make it a prize in the eye of some people something special that need to be captured or owned such wa the case with a four year old albino raccoon in georgia for part of her early life isi the albino raccoon had a miserable existence because of her unique look someone captured her and locked her in a small wire cage intending to use her for a taxidermy project luckily there wa good news in store for her the georgia department of natural resource rescued isi and delivered the raccoon to maxine rainey below director of the georgia animal sanctuary a new hope but both the sanctuary and the department of natural resource feared she wa a lost cause understandably isi wa aggressive human touch scared her and she lashed out at anyone trying to help her since she wa described a so aggressive maxine said we were just going to hold her for a couple of day but then what when maxine accepted the albino raccoon she gave the poor animal a look over she had urine burn smelled horrendous wa obese losing hair and had sore all over her foot no wonder she wa aggressive maxine though had hope for the poor animal she sat in the enclosure with the animal that by all account should ve been trying to tear her head off if she got too close but amazingly that didn t happen i d been going through some stuff in my personal life maxine said and i wa kind of having a sad day so i sat by her and she came right up to me she came up and sniffed me and put her little hand in my hand from there the raccoon s life only got better she s so gentle maxine said she spent the last couple day glued to my side sleeping on my lap having me carry her around i just saw a complete 180 degree flip in her personality the minute she wa exposed to some kindness for a raccoon once deemed so aggressive she had to be kept away from other raccoon at the facility that s a pretty glowing review but the story of isi only underscored the worry of rodney jones the chief of kanawha s park police department people like james butler are often fascinated with animal that are different and unique but it s important to remember they re

spit out a seemingly never ending bucket list of thing we absolutely must do before we die place to see book to read urinal to pee in and a we all inch closer to our imminent death buzzfeed creates more and more of these article making it seemingly impossible to accomplish all of these thing before we kick the can if you re a young and bored a i am though you might wonder could you pull it off could you actually check everything off the buzzfeed bucket list and if so how long would it take a little while ago i set out to find out for myself here s how i did it first i had to compile all of the list buzzfeed ha published in it before you die format at the time i filed this story there were 182 list these ranged from appreciating the little thing in life like watching the sunset to full blown adventure like going to south africa s version of burning man buzzfeed writer also seem obsessed with food since practically every other list is about stuffing your face with 21 amazing aussie burger or the ten best new orleans po boy or the 15 best cheese toasties in london next i cataloged each task on each of the 182 list there are over a thousand individual task on motherboard counting the hour i ve spent on the internet next i calculated the time it would take to complete each of the task this is where it all got slightly more complicated since the time it would take to do most of these thing is highly individualized eating fish and chip for example how long doe that take the average person if you were really vying for time you could probably scarf some down in five minute but i d much prefer to spend an hour savoring of a nice greasy plate and what if the restaurant wa really busy and it took a long time for your server to bring the fish and chip to you i settled on 30 minute for eating fish and chip a well a the other food related task other task required a fair amount of research like hiking the camino de santiago otherwise known a st james path between spain and france which is le like a path and more like a pilgrimage the trail is nearly 500 mile long according to the trail s official website it take four to six week to complete i decided to allot 30 day to complete the trail even though the website also noted that you would need to hike 18 mile per day without any rest day to finish the trail in that time which seems completely insane i repeated this process for every single task on buzzfeed s list again there are over a thousand individual task here is a time table showing a small sample of the time i allotted for certain task some of the list contained fast easy task that be completed entirely from your couch like this one which requires you to look at 20 picture of miniature pig before you die but for most of them you have to travel some of the list like the five highest place to visit before you die require you to jet set from the haiku stair of oahu hawaii to the petronas tower of kuala lumpur malaysia to the taihang mountain in china in order to accomplish all of the task most effectively you would need to travel the world so i decided to calculate the travel time that it would take to work your way around the world in an order most efficient for accomplishing each of the buzzfeed task i decided to begin my hypothetical bucket list journey in boston where i live and work my way west through north america i would visit 36 state in the united state and stop in canada and mexico along the way then onto the dominican republic to explore the three shipwreck of bayahibe followed by stop at turk and caicos and belize some stop later i d spend 175 hour and ten minute flying from country to country in europe stopping in estonia to see the beech tree in hiiumaa before taking a quick ten minute flight over to finland to go to the kontula indoor skatepark in helsinki i d make my way over to turkey to swim in the crystal blue mineral water of the pamukkale spring in hierapolis and then pop over to jordan to grab a drink at the cave bar in petra i whittled the travel time down to one hour flight over border stopping in some country for only a few minute to visit a bakery or for a few hour to watch a sport game in total the round the world trip would take 26 day in travel time alone and would include 108 country the last thing i calculated wa sleep time i figured a person would be fairly tired after spending month on end climbing mountain reading play and visiting museum every day so i allotted the doctor recommended eight hour per night i really enjoy sleeping so this is painful for me to even imagine but when you re racing to finish an extensive bucket list in the fastest amount possible i suppose luxuriating in the rem cycle shouldn t be a priority i also factored in how long it took me to calculate the trip around 40 hour in total and how long it would take to actually book the flight hotel and day trip which would be possibly twice that in conclusion drumroll please i determined it would take 1 448 7 day to do everything that buzzfeed say you need to do before you die that s 207 week or just shy of four year i ll repeat that some of the timing calculation were arbitrary you could get stuck in a restaurant with poor service and it might take double the time to eat your fish and chip or you could arrive somewhere like the trinity church on king george island in antarctica and decide it wa too boring to stay the full hour your flight could get delayed or you could get food poisoning at one of the restaurant and choose to bail on the next day s activity if you got the timing wrong you might miss the small window when all 39 christmas market on the list are open or arrive at the mendenhall ice cave in juneau alaska to find that they have all melted but if you planned it just right and you had the time money and stamen to accomplish everything on the list then you could definitely do it that said i m not sure why anyone would want to there are a lot of thing on that list that i personally have no interest in doing why should i visit 39 different christmas market across europe i mean i m sure they re beautiful and each have nice hot chocolate and giant neon candy cane but what s the harm in not seeing all 39 of them is it really worth the hour it would take to learn all 44 of these air guitar song would i really be a lesser person for not having visited these 19 penis shaped object around the world i m not saying i wouldn t do it if someone offered me the chance to travel the world and see some of the coolest thing this earth ha to

twice a year you go against the ram twice a year you go against the arizona cardinal twice a year that s not an easy conference but we try to the ultimate goal for u is to go 1 0 every week and to block out all the noise and to focus on one game in a week that s a big part of my philosophy and our team philosophy is just to go 1 0 every week and just try to win that one game and see what happens you were ranked 17th in the nfl top 100 where would you rank yourself and what do you have to do to be ranked higher next year that s not for me to worry about all i care about is our team

think it s a good idea to request that our kid purchase expo marker in bulk or box of kleenex that should be supplied already especially when those might not get used by my kid who think it should be my job to bring ziploc bag to school well i ll tell you who this mom i m not going to buy just the one extra box of tissue because let s all be honest here i can afford more than that and gasp what if someone other than my precious timmy us them well then haven t i done a good deed for the year for le than the cost of a coffee we should all be interested in what will create the best learning environment for all these kid for all these little people who will be making big decision some day like what to do with your social security or how to fix your city infrastructure or how best to treat that cancerous mass in your body if you don t agree with something on the list and think it s excessive have a conversation with the teacher i guarantee if it is something that will actually get used to educate your child the teacher will be able to explain how yes expo marker are expensive get in a classroom and watch child solve problem at their desk sometimes on them with them and really engage in the process because it all of a sudden became colorful and perhaps a little bit taboo you think you have to buy too many glue stick i invite you to join a class when they do a simple sorting and gluing project that give the kid one more opportunity to understand all the augh word and their various pronunciation and watch multiple child go through half a stick just for that one project more is more right and yes the theory is that you teach them to use le but let s be honest some just use what they use watch kid clean the floor at the end of the day and in a rush to get home throw away all the trash they found which includes half used pencil and crayon that would take too long to find a home for so let s fast forward to january the supply are no longer new and shiny and more than a few have met their untimely trash can demise used and broken crayon look better in that circular file than in pencil box glue stick that still have some in them but are not the easiest to use just aren t worth it anymore marker find new home in backpack pencil that have no eraser have lost their appeal dry erase marker are dried up because they have been used to solve spell create and then what happens supply that were an extra 10 from you at the beginning of the year for one kid become extra in your kid s teacher s cart at target during a grocery run and forget the 10 oh no multiply that sucker by how many kid were in that classroom wa it 20 30 let s see doe your job ask you to shell out a couple hundred buck to upgrade your software or buy staple and if it s teaching your kid how to multiply better or be able to compose a sentence without referring to spell check isn t that extra 10 a little worth it i m frustrated by our entitlement we act like we re doing the school and the teacher a favor when we fill that backpack with tissue and marker umm let s back up a minute aren t they the one doing u the favor i mean are we willing to take a step or 200 backward and fill in gap caused by something a silly a a distracted kid who then distracts others because he can t find a glue stick to finish his project and yes we went through school without some of these thing but these

editor and a bunch of smaller feature didn t up sale enough to justify tearing off the price tag the cost of development of this dlc ended up being around 90 000 euro thea s developer wrote the dlc wa free and about 8 000 of our player have enjoyed it within the first two week after the release sale after the dlc brought about 10 000 euro above what we were usually selling without the dlc and normalized in about 10 day sponsored so if we were to judge thing by those figure alone we would have lost a big chunk of cash they added working with a publisher wa a huge saving grace here a we did not carry the cost of the localization which the publisher invested in to eventually regain from the box sale still for u the giant did not prove to be a huge financial hit and it wa disheartening despite that they decided to stick with their free dlc plan in the meantime they saw player recommending the game mentioning substantial free dlc a a big plus some even went a step further people began to create forum thread encouraging others to buy thea for their friend the developer wrote organised their own giveaway and even doing their own community translation for their for their second major free dlc they decided to take a more tactical approach this one added multiplayer and they decided to release it close to the steam summer sale to drum up additional interest sound like it worked they explained i mentioned earlier how timing wa an issue for giant and i believe we have learnt our lesson we stuck to our deadline used a faster service to do our shortened localization and we released the multiprayer dlc during the steam summer sale our sale this month had a 1572 increase from the previous month on steam and while the sale is likely the main culprit here we still think

the most consistent criticism of mad men from those who aren t mad men fan is that sniff derisively it s only beloved by the coastal medium elite because it s about rich white people who live glamorous life and work in advertising that strain of criticism became all the more pronounced in the buildup to the amc drama s series finale with vulture launching the latest broadside against the show s popularity a author michael idov argued that it wasn t truly popular just overhyped to support his claim he point in part to the show s lack of an audience in russia to some degree this is true back when the series debuted the medium wrote about mad men to a level far exceeding it actual rating the first season s viewership number dipped below the 1 million mark a few time a much more perilous event in an age when dvrs and streaming service were le prevalent but by season two the award and critical attention mad men garnered ended up boosting those number to more comfortable level and even if the show wa never a smash hit it had a long healthy run still there are a bunch of good mostly reductive reason for the medium to keep in idov s word shoving mad men down reader throat here are five 1 reader wanted to read about it in my pre vox life i wa the tv editor of the a v club a position that gave me unique insight into what sort of tv content reader wanted to consume and every time we wrote about mad men those number spiked the show wa consistently among the top five series we wrote about in term of readership and a well timed thinkpiece always had the potential to blow up the mad men audience overlap so neatly with the audience of people who read about tv on the internet that the venn diagram of the two might a well be a single circle this ha carried right over to vox we write a lot about the show because there s a huge audience out there ready to devour mad men content far beyond any other show i ve written about here that s not game of throne the mad men audience overlap so neatly with the audience of people who read about tv on the internet that the venn diagram of the two might a well be a single circle yes the huge explosion of commentary in the day preceding the show s finale wa driven by how much many of u in the medium liked the show but it wa also driven by the fact that our reader wanted to see this sort of material some of that wa an accident of timing 2 mad men debuted right after the soprano ended and filled the void the show left when mad men began in the summer of 2007 the soprano had ended just a few week before the wire never a popular in term of raw readership number though no slouch itself would end in early 2008 lost wa the king of the recap roost at the time but those who wrote about it usually focused more on grand unified theory of why the show worked rather than the sort of symbolic interpretation the soprano invited mad men also benefitted from the rise of tv recapping in general thus there wa a huge opening in the reading about tv on the internet marketplace that wa beginning to boom in the late 2000s and mad men filled it a surely a it filled the slot vacated by soprano at the golden globe and the emmy the two show thematic concern use of dreamlike imagery and storytelling structure were incredibly similar which only helped matter but mad men also benefited from the rise of tv recapping in general alan sepinwall began his seminal blog what s alan watching in late 2005 and by that final soprano season dozen of publication were dipping their toe into the recap water that number would explode in year to come and mad men wa a natural fit for publication that wanted to write tv recap and people who wanted to read them 3 there just wasn t a much good tv on when mad men started it wa popular to suggest that the end of the soprano the cancellation of hbo s deadwood and the impending end of the wire signaled the end of tv s golden age sound familiar instead mad men and later breaking bad picked up that ball and ran with it while fx entered the early stage of a hot streak that continues to this day but really in that summer of 2007 the established show worth writing about were few and far between especially if you didn t want to publish weekly in depth review of comedy a later development largely driven by content hungry site like well the a v club they were essentially limited to the wire dexter lost hero 24 grey s anatomy and maybe veronica mar if your readership wa especially young thus it wa easy to get the serious tv audience to tune in to mad men because there weren t a ton of other option mad men suggested every cable channel should have it own scripted drama series in development and now they pretty much all do contrast that to today when a show like the american can t get the same sort of readership traction a mad men even though it ha a loyal dedicated audience that like reading about it simply because there s so much more stuff out there this most recent season of that fx drama received the kind of acclaim mad men did in it heyday but it s much much harder for a series to cut through the noise from all those other show out there mad men suggested every single cable channel should have it own scripted drama in development and now they pretty much all do 4 mad men wa actually pretty popular when all wa said and done though it never pulled in big bang theory number amc told vulture s joe adalian that at the show s height a total of just under 7 million people watched it that number s not insignificant and even a tiny percentage of that audience consistently reading piece about the show online would be more than enough to drive significant traffic to most website especially back in 2007 when the overall online readership wa smaller 5 never underestimate passion a my colleague matthew yglesias wrote about the popularity of bernie sander presidential candidacy online a small but rabidly passionate audience for a particular topic can be lifeblood to a website that craves reader what hold true for sander is also true for mad men there are very few casual mad men fan and those passionate fan tend to seek out everything they can find about the show early on the medium positioned mad men a a sort of lifestyle choice the medium is of course at least somewhat complicit in this early on we positioned the series a a sort of lifestyle choice if you were cool you would watch mad men but tv site have said that about a lot of show over the year and few of them held up readership wise a well a mad men did whither boardwalk empire yes the early push might have been a bit much but mad men ended up having the good at least for the people who cared about it i agree with the theoretical concern behind the criticism of medium coverage of mad men those of u who write about television do too often ignore the show that a majority of american are actually watching show like the big bang theory and ncis and even empire but the kind of people who read our website are also far more likely to want to take a deep dive into the latest episode of mad men than they are to want to read a careful analysis of even

of pulse per day this is equivalent to one small can or about a third of a 400 gram large can of baked bean pulse are high in vegetable protein and fibre they lower blood cholesterol in a number of way the soluble and insoluble fibre assist with lowering cholesterol absorption in the gut while they promote growth of beneficial gut bacteria in the large bowel legume and pulse take longer to digest compared to processed food this mean you tend to eat le when they re part of a meal 2 eat plant sterol margarine and spread plant sterol or phytosterols are chemically similar to blood cholesterol and are found in some plant food including nut they are concentrated from plant source and then added to some commonly eaten food such a margarine spread or milk plant sterol compete with two other type of cholesterol for absorption from the gut pre made cholesterol which is found in some food like prawn and cholesterol which is made in your liver this competition process lower the total amount of cholesterol that eventually end up in your blood a review concluded that two gram of plant sterol a day lead to an 8 10 percent reduction in ldl cholesterol the type of fat the plant sterol are mixed with is important a meta analysis of 32 randomised control trial involving around 2 100 people found bigger reduction in total cholesterol a mix of good and bad type and ldl cholesterol when plant sterol were added to margarine or spread derived from canola or rapeseed oil rather than sunflower or soybean oil 3 eat nut nut are high in protein and fat but the amount of polyunsaturated monounsaturated and saturated fat vary in a review of 25 intervention trial eating approximately 67g of nut a day about half a cup led to a 5 1 percent reduction in total cholesterol and 7 4 percent for ldl it didn t matter what type of nut people ate the more nut the bigger the cholesterol reduction people with higher ldl cholesterol at baseline or who were not overweight had a bigger improvement one caution is that half a cup of nut contains about 400 calorie 1600kj so you need to eat nut instead of another food or eat le each day but have them every day 4 use olive oil olive oil is a major component of the mediterranean diet and the predominant source of fat olive oil contains a high proportion of monounsaturated fat more than 80 percent of olive oil s healthy compound called phenolic compound are lost during the refining process so le refined variety such a virgin olive oil are a better choice a review of eight trial that included 350 people consuming high phenolic olive oil found medium effect on lowering blood pressure and small effect on lowering oxidised ldl a type of ldl with no significant effect on total or ldl cholesterol in contrast another trial randomly selected over 7 400 men and woman at high risk of heart disease to follow three diet the mediterranean diet plus extra virgin olive oil or mediterranean diet plus nut or a control diet low fat after 4 8 year follow up those in both the olive oil and nut group had a 30 percent lower risk of heart attack stroke or death from heart disease compared to control in a recent trial 47 men and woman were randomised to substitute 4 5 percent of their usual foodintake of olive oil or butter for five week and then crossed over to the other group for another five week researcher found total cholesterol and ldl cholesterol level were significantly higher after consuming butter compared to olive oil the reduction wa biggest in those who had high blood cholesterol to start with switching to a healthier spread make sense for those with high cholesterol 5 avoid junk food in our study we found people were able to make a number of smaller change across a range of the food that lower blood cholesterol level including increasing nut soy food and plant sterol but the biggest change people made wa cutting back on energy dense nutrient poor food junk food and eating a wider variety of healthy food the benefit of making these change they lowered their cholesterol lost weight and lowered their blood pressure a big study examined change in diet quality score and heart disease risk in 29 000 men from the health professional follow up study and 51 000 woman from the nurse health study 1986 2010 after four year of follow up almost 11 000 people had a heart disease event those who had

new finding from the pew research center 40 percent of marriage involve one spouse who s been married before in 20 percent of new marriage both spouse have previously said i do there s so much dialogue right now about the retreat from marriage in general gretchen livingston senior researcher at pew and author of the study told the huffington post i wa really curious to juxtapose that with what s going on with remarriage livingston analyzed data from the 2013 american community survey a well a the 1960 and 1980 census and found that the number of remarried adult in the u ha hit 42 million which is almost double the amount recorded in 1980 and triple the amount in 1960 but not everyone is jumping to remarry after combining the hard data on remarriage pattern with the result of a recent pew survey about marriage livingston found that specific demographic are actually le likely to remarry than others among those who are divorced or widowed age made a big difference in desire to remarry there are two demographic shift that can account for this general surge in remarriage according to livingston for one the divorce rate is higher now than it wa in 1960 so the number of people who are a she put it eligible to remarry ha also risen but it s worth noting that the divorce rate peaked in 1981 and ha been slowly declining and leveling off ever since the more influential factor in the high remarriage rate however is a longer life expectancy for partner particularly among baby boomer while only 34 percent of those who were 65 and older and eligible to remarry had remarried in 1960 50 percent of that same demographic had remarried in 2013 the older you are the more likely you are to have ever remarried because you have more time in your life to have married once gotten divorced or widowed and found someone else and remarried livingston said younger american went the opposite direction 75 percent of people age 25 to 34 and eligible to remarry were remarried in 1960 while only 43 percent of that same demographic were remarried in 2013 it s very possible that this younger group of contemporary divorcee and widow hasn t soured on the institution of marriage completely however livingston pointed out that since younger demographic have tended to delay marriage the average age of first marriage is now is about 27 for woman and 29 for men a opposed to 21 for woman and 24 for men in 1960 perhaps this group is content to cohabit with partner or advance the relationship in other way rather than jump into marriage number two overall woman were le likely than men to want to walk down the aisle again age wasn t the only differentiating factor though when pew polled participant for the aforementioned survey on marriage they asked single men and woman who had been married before if they would be willing to marry again there wa a clear gender divide divorced or widowed men were more likely to want to remarry than woman in the same position a majority of once married eligible men 65 percent either expressed a desire to remarry or were still considering it in comparison 43 percent of woman said they d be willing to remarry and 54 percent specifically didn t want to ever marry again only 30 percent of men were completely against the idea of a second walk down the aisle previous study have suggested that men enjoy more health benefit relationship satisfaction and economic perk from marriage than woman do livingston said it s quite possible that widowed or divorced men have more motivation to jump back into a new marriage and regain those aforementioned comfort another interesting finding combined both age and gender in remarriage 16 percent of couple involve a husband who is at least 10 year older than his wife this age gap fall to a mere 4 percent in first time married couple if you consider that 39 percent of first time newlywed and 21 percent of remarried couple are within a year of each other s age this age gap among remarried couple becomes particularly noteworthy but don t make too many assumption about newlywed it s a demographic that s still in flux while today s divorce rate might make newlywed of the 1960s cringe that doesn t mean that today s society ha lost faith in marriage in fact according to pew previously married people these day are just a willing to remarry a they were back in 1960 taken together these finding can add more detail to an ever shifting image of the american family maybe newlywed don t look quite a fresh faced a they did in the late 60 livingston said noting once again that 40 percent

trump ha the right personality and temperament to serve a president by contrast 39 percent of democrat say that about clinton now this is only one poll and the temperament number for both candidate

virginia by 52 38 among registered voter and by 51 43 among likely voter note the poll also find that trump is viewed unfavorably by 70 percent of woman and 70 percent of white college graduate this once again suggests that trump s failure to broaden his appeal is putting him at a major disadvantage in state that are supposed to be very close a virginia wa in 2012 quote of the day everyone hate trump edition the post write up of the new virginia poll includes this gem from a republican leaning voter in the state walt purnell 71 a retired business executive from ashburn had hoped to vote for jeb bush or john kasich or marco rubio or chris christie but trump no way i think he s a failure i think he s a fraud i think he s a con artist i think he s insane purnell said have we mentioned that this election is becoming a referendum on trump s fundamental unfitness for the job clinton owns the airwave chuck todd mark murray and the first read crew serve up these striking number hillary clinton s campaign ha spent 61 million over the airwave while pro clinton outside group have chipped in an additional 43 million that s a combined 104 million in total ad spending for team clinton but in that same time frame donald trump s campaign still hasn t spent a single cent on a general election ad with two pro trump outside group coming to the rescue with 12 4 million over the airwave that s a nearly 9 to 1 advantage in ad spending it s another fundamental trumpian disadvantage that could grow more pronounced in the home stretch trump would probably send troop to mideast the new york time make a good point about trump s big foreign policy speech yesterday though mr trump made no reference to whether he would send more american troop back to the region that appeared to be the clear implication the kind of relentless attack on the islamic state he advocate along with taking and holding the oil field which may well be a violation of international law would require a considerable presence by american troop or their ally and foreign base to launch the drone trump s promise is basically to promise to crush the terrorist enemy while vowing no messy entanglement abroad it s a scam trump s policy gibberish trump is now proposing to impose a new ideological test on those trying to enter the country from area scarred by terrorism cnn analyst peter bergen explains why the idea is half baked at best this seems unworkable for example would anyone sitting for these test volunteer that they had secret proclivity for jihadist terrorism also trump didn t specify what country would be affected by this new test but france ha a serious domestic terrorism problem would french citizen be subjected to this kind of test in short trump didn t say who would be targeted for these ideological test saying only that he would consult the state department about how to approach this issue the idea is really an effort to repackage trump s muslim ban a somehow being in sync with american value trump s big lie about isi trump continues to claim a he did in his speech yesterday that obama policy were the chief cause of isi glenn kessler corrects the record this is false and facile the terror group is the direct result of the u s invasion of iraq in 2003 at best one could argue that action that obama failed to take over clinton s opposition helped contribute to the growth of isi what s always missing from trump s account is that clinton wa more hawkish than obama wa meanwhile kessler s interview with author joby warrick explores all this in more detail trump may cost

surprise are my regular column investigating the latest software and hardware for the best feature biggest problem hidden behind the headline nasty surprise 1 goodbye sapphire the first concern come courtesy of popular youtube channel jerryrigeverything the famously diligent test site ran the iphone 7 through the durability test and claim apple ha ditched it premium sapphire glass from both the new home button and the camera lens the revelation come after jerryrigeverything used hardness pick to determine the makeup of both surface on the mohs scale of mineral hardness previously his test on the iphone 6 confirmed the presence of sapphire but this time both the new home button and larger camera of the iphone 7 scratched easily using pick that do not damage sapphire he concludes we know for sure that it is regular glass and not sapphire and here s where it get interesting because apple still advertises that both the iphone 7 and iphone 7 plus a using sapphire which is considerably more expensive than toughened glass on the home button and camera lens given the new iphones are marketed a more durable than ever this would be a major let down i have put these claim to apple and will update when if the company responds note a jerryrigeverything ha not tested the iphone 7 plus we cannot make assumption here being the more expensive model it s possible sapphire is still used there nasty surprise 2 new home button new limitation the controversy around the new home button continue a well following a discovery by myke hurley eagle eyed founder of relayfm who spotted the button only responds to capacitive touch not pressure this mean the button will not react should you be wearing standard glove since there is no response anymore to physical movement a he point out if you want to test this for yourself then put some material such a your shirt t shirt over the button and try pressing that s right you get nothing hardly ideal when winter and you need to wear glove there are a couple of way around this firstly you can invest in touchscreen glove which use conductive thread to transfer the mild electrical charge in your skin to which capacitive touchscreen respond note that s a bogus claim that these don t work but i ve tried two pair and they do secondly you can setup assistivetouch though that s primarily used for when an old physical home button is broken outside warranty feel free to insert your joke of choice here designed by apple for apple all of which leaf me in two mind about the iphone 7 s biggest external change and who they really help the most for example the new home button kill a weak spot in iphone design for apple a the old physical button wa notorious for going wrong it save on warranty claim but the taptic engine required to simulate physical movement us all the space vacated by the headphone jack a the photo from ifixit illustrates below i m not convinced many user would consider this the best way to utilise the additional space the headphone jack used personally a far bigger battery would ve been top of my list then there are little cost cutting omission if sapphire ha indeed been dropped from the iphone 7 then that is a notable one sapphire is 5 10x more expensive than toughened glass meanwhile there are little packaging shortcut such a the removal of the earphone case instead earphone with the iphone

that gender identity is not a male female binary but a continuum along which any individual may fall depending on a variety of factor including anatomy chromosome hormone and feeling but the dichotomy is so deeply embedded in our culture that even the most radical activist had been focused mainly on expanding the definition of the two pre existing category today a growing number of student are

with transgender right percolating through the court arrived on campus already l g b t friendly and in many case equipped with gender neutral housing and bathroom in hope of raising consciousness of the bias built into social structure and into the language we use to discus them student are organizing identity conference and inventing new vocabulary which include pronoun like ze and xe and pressing administration to make change that validate in language the existence of a gender outside the binary certainly there s a long line of people throughout history whose trait have put them outside norm and some culture long ago formalized the existence of a gender that isn t purely female or purely male like the american indian s two spirit or india s hijras but the binary is a belief system at least a old a adam and eve and most people don t even realize it s there it s like a constant coming out process educating those around you that there is a gender binary and this is what it mean to identify outside of it said gieselman who work on campus planning gender related event identifying a genderqueer is an opportunity to self invent unburdened from social expectation about dress

transgender student inability to use bathroom marked men or woman for fear of a confrontation with a confused classmate being accused of using a stolen student id in the cafeteria because the name printed on it didn t match someone s gender appearance and having the faculty rely on a student information system that listed only legal name leading to occasion when a student might be embarrassed or inadvertently outed m brauer heard about one distraught transgender freshman whose professor while calling roll first read the student s feminine legal name then announced the male nickname m brauer reached out to the registrar keith p williams who worked with the university s lawyer to allow transgender student to change their first name in the schoolwide system but doing so required an in person visit to the dean of student office and filling out paperwork she then set to work waging a campaign to educate face to face member of the faculty staff and administration on why language sensitivity wa so important to a student s self respect and assisted student in getting school policy amended to specifically prohibit discrimination based on gender identity by 2009 faculty member themselves began pushing for a broader solution to the identification issue and mr williams created a task force to look into how student could register a preferred first name without having to make a special request the task force realized that the only way to guarantee a professor would properly refer to a student wa to supply the student s pronoun on class roster and advisee list then came the question of which gender neutral pronoun to offer student proposed they them pronoun but the faculty vetoed the idea because they said it is grammatically incorrect mr williams recalled they said you don t put a plural pronoun with a single individual a second option also being used in various trans community wa ze pronounced zee a riff on the german pronoun sie with hir replacing his her bowing to the faculty the task force selected ze and revised it information system becoming the first school in the nation at which student could select their pronoun they could also leave the field blank or opt for name only indicating a preference for being referred to by name instead of by pronoun the change fueled gender awareness campaign by student all over the country so many administrator were receiving request that in 2012 the american association of collegiate registrar and admission officer convened a task force to draft a list of best practice for handling transgender student record so

rusty young wrote marching powder in his twenty when a a young backpacker from sydney australia he stayed in the prison and later helped secure mr mcfadden s release by posing a an international human right lawyer it all began when mr mcfadden a british tanzanian wa caught smuggling cocaine in la paz airport in 1996 and found himself jailed in a place more like a warped small town than a prison prisoner were expected to earn a living inside and buy their cell a if they were real estate there wa a primary school for the prisoner child who they brought to live with them and in the most notorious twist of all there wa an in house cocaine factory i thought what is this place i even had to pay my own taxi fare to get there thomas mcfadden remembers today after his release in 2000 he left those day far behind and is now a chicken farmer in tanzania however his life changing friendship with his brother rusty ha gone the distance and he ha even named one of his child after him their unusual relationship began when mr young joined one of the illegal prison tour that the inmate ran for foreign backpacker from early 1997 until his release word had spread around local hostel that there wa an english speaking inmate who would show visitor around this strange microcosm centrally located in downtown la paz the prison became a tourist attraction that featured in lonely planet

after the prison despite her joke she is acutely well aware of the darker side of the story i m still confused by it still processing it she say over the course of three week we went most day i sometimes question why it wa mostly just to share experience and to understand how life start the same but can take such different path san pedro prison remains operational today despite many plan to close it for year it tour were an open secret but one day in 2009 a local television crew arrived to get footage for a story about a politician held inside while waiting in the plaza outside the cameraman caught a steady stream of tourist going in armed with the footage the bolivian press ran with the story the main concern locally wa not the tourist but the alleged corruption of the authority who were thought to be taking a cut of the tour profit who is watching the police asked an editorial in la razon newspaper during the ensuing clean up prisoner had their visitor right revoked for a day a riot followed and around 80 child were evacuated in 2013 the story took an even darker turn when news spread of a 12 year old girl becoming pregnant inside the jail after an alleged rape by her imprisoned father and other men child welfare charity called for a ban on child living inside large scale tour of the prison are no longer possible today backpacker typically opt for la paz walking tour which stop outside the prison wall and tell marching powder s story when rusty young and thomas mcfadden returned to the prison for their forthcoming documentary wildlands they happened upon one such tour group and snuck alongside them incognito they kept making factual error so i couldn t help asking smart arsed question say mr young eventually an irish traveller who had just read the book recognised the pair he whispered you re rusty you re thomas and we sneaked off together for a beer back in 2000 the two men travelled to colombia after mr mcfadden s release they found work a english teacher and worked on the book which became a new york time best seller thomas then moved to tanzania and rusty went back to australia where after the huge success of marching

makemake s light and heat observation from the spitzer and herschel space telescope revealed warm dark area on makemake s otherwise bright cold surface however makemake s apparently mottled surface would not make sense with a normally rotating dwarf planet unless it wa spinning with one of it pole facing directly toward earth a fairly unlikely situation the dark moon hypothesis offered a simpler explanation a charcoal black moon orbiting makemake imagine that the dark material isn t on makemake s surface it s in orbit image analysis lead and paper coauthor alex parker tweeted if the moon is very dark it account for most previous thermal measurement makemake is the second farthest away of the official dwarf planet eris is the farthest and the second brightest after pluto while it may seem strange that astronomer had been able to see moon around farther and dimmer planet while missing makemake s moon the reality is that this moon informally called mk2 wa very good at remaining hidden mk2 is over 1300 time dimmer and much smaller than makemake and it orbit appears to be edge on to earth so we don t see it circling makemake only oscillating back and forth looking for it is like looking for a firefly flitting back and forth across a spotlight if you watch it long enough and are lucky enough to look at the right time a this team of astronomer did the firefly might look obvious in parker s word not actually that faint but it wa easy to miss before part of a team from the southwest research institute in boulder colorado parker wa the first to notice makemake s moon in data from the hubble space telescope at first he thought someone else must have already seen it just to be sure he asked collaborator and team leader marc buie ha anyone seen the moon in the makemake data when buie replied there s a moon in the makemake data they knew they d made a major discovery the moon in the data it is unclear where exactly the moon came from or why it surface is black more observation of mk2 from hubble will help astronomer determine whether it orbit is circular or elliptical which will provide clue to it origin if mk2 s orbit is elongated it wa probably simply captured

that cover makemake in place however mk2 s darkness could be due to constant interaction with the escaping atmospheric gas streaming off makemake like the top of a hearth blackened with ash it could have accumulated compound from makemake s past atmosphere if mk2 s orbit is circular a preliminary estimate indicate the moon may be merely debris from a collision between makemake and another kuiper

impact the new improved makemake system while mk2 doe create question about the makemake system and the kuiper belt it will also provide answer according to parker the discovery of this moon ha given u an opportunity to study makemake in far greater detail than we ever would have been able to without the companion makemake is sometimes referred to a pluto s little sister because of their similarity both are dwarf planet both have surface coated in methane ice and both have temperature that can drop to 400 degree fahrenheit the discovery that makemake ha a moon add yet another similarity to pluto when pluto s largest moon charon wa discovered in 1978 it led to enormous new insight about pluto itself including that it wa hundred of time lighter than wa originally estimated that s the kind of transformative measurement that having a satellite can enable parker said mk2 will almost definitely lead to a fundamental change in how we view the dwarf planet makemake looking at how mk2 orbit makemake will allow scientist to calculate the system s mass and probe it inner composition a caltech s mike brown a member of the team that discovered makemake in 2005 said the wide range of density of the dwarf planet is one of the most interesting mystery out there but we still have so few object that each one add a critical part of the story small world like makemake display a variety of internal composition they can contain rock and water ice a well a other more exotic ice and compound since mk2 will allow scientist to tell makemake s density and thus the density of the material it s made of it provides a new clue about the family of dwarf planet the james webb space telescope scheduled to launch in 2018 will be able to conclusively test the dark moon hypothesis even before then though information about makemake and it moon will continue to accumulate from new hubble observation teaching u about the outskirt of our solar system this new discovery open a new

we are all excited about battlefield 1 we are actually lucky that the game s setting didn t get rejected while speaking at the investor day event ea studio executive vice president patrick soderlund said that the setting wa originally not approved by ea the thing that andrew spoke about in regard to the setting and why we decided to go for world war i it wasn t the most obvious choice if you look at what other partner in our industry are going they re going into sci fi we had a lot of success with in the modern military space but we felt that there wa a need for a change and when the team presented to me the idea of world war i i absolutely rejected it however thing changed after dice showed him a small demo of what it had in mind this convinced him that the idea could actually work and the company bit the bullet and it paid off big time i said world war i is trench warfare it can t be fun to play but anyway the team continued to persist in the fact that this can be fun and showed up with a very short demo that convinced me at least that this wa the right path soderlund wa amazed by the reception the trailer for battlefield 1 got and he seemed very pleased that the audience connected in the way it did with the company s decision to switch from modern day setting to world war 1 the good news is that whenever you take creative risk and it work you actually can get to substantial success and i think that what the internet is telling u with 31 million view and the most seen trailer of the history of ea is that the world war i theme is resonating with player out

getting stung by a wasp can be extremely painful and sometimes even fatal if not handled correctly one man from tampa florida wa out gardening on a seemingly normal day when he did not notice a wasp nest hidden beneath some plant in his front lawn john clark missed the nest and accidentally stepped on it ushering a swarm of yellow jacket to come out and attack him john got stung four time and made his way inside to rest and get treatment hi wife went and grabbed john an ice pack to help reduce the swelling and john sat down to try and recover from the extremely painful sting that were attacking his body soon after getting stung though john started acting strange he started experiencing numbness and had difficulty breathing something wa evidently not right it wa only an hour after getting stung when john wa gasping for air and told his wife three last word i love you before he took his last breath and died doctor did everything they could to get his system back up and running but to no avail this wa the case of a severe allergic reaction that john had experienced called anaphylaxis this type of condition can be triggered from an allergic reaction from a wasp like john wa stung by but this type of condition is extremely dangerous due to it stealth many people do not even know they can get anaphylaxis from a wasp or bee sting and anybody can develop it at any point in their lifetime it is important to get tested for this type of reaction if you are going to be spending time outdoors or doing yard work you never know when you might get stung by a bee even if it s just doing the front garden like john wa a simple way to prevent the severe and deadly reaction is with an epipen which injects a measured dose of epinephrine into your body to stop the reaction but

giving from handing 5 to a homeless person on the street in manhattan to raising 450 to give to a working father of one in rural south africa we believe in the virtue of sharing abundance in an empowering fashion that enables people to decide how best to allocate their resource themselves when we found givedirectly in november 2015 an org that give 1 000 unconditionally to people who are in extreme poverty a a solution to get them out of extreme poverty we fell in love unconditional they can do anything they want with it which is incredibly empowering to recipient but many people in the west think it s risky or even foolish we ve told countless friend and family about givedirectly and the concept of transferring cash is met with much skepticism soliciting response such a eh i only give people food and others such a how do they make sure people aren t defrauding them or stealing the cash i bet most people waste or squander the cash it probably doesn t have long term impact such a building a school could general angst about the savior barbie complex where western people go out to save people in poor country by telling them what they should do often a self serving endeavor and more after dealing with the frequent barrage of opposing view but always holding strong to our personal conviction we decided to dig for some more answer and see how many of these hole they were poking in our own justification could be filled since we currently travel abroad full time and kenya is an incredible country we decided to head out for a field visit and take a real peek under the hood of gd s operation outside of givedirectly s country headquarters in kisumu kenya in august 2016 my wife and i visited givedirectly s office in kisumu kenya and spent two 10 hour day in the field visiting real past recipient in the siaya where president obama s grandmother life and homa bay region after meeting the team on the ground and hearing about their day to day work we were really surprised and impressed by five main thing that actually directly addressed a lot of the negative feedback we ve heard in the past the vast majority of the team are local kenyan only two of around 80 or so employee are expat we think that s fantastic since we ve already known that 91 of the cash that we personally give to gd go directly into the field but actually a solid portion of the 9 administrative cost actually funnel into creating local job that afford hundred more people in east africa the opportunity to build bright future for themselves there s a huge unemployment issue in kenya and other east african country and foreign investment is still far behind demand so this kind of job creation ha a huge impact on the community beyond the employment opportunity the real incredible moment for u came when we had the chance to speak individually with a few of the local on the team candidly they are all proud to be working their ass off to improve the life of people in their own community we even heard two separate story from some senior level guy still under 30 year old who were driven to work at givedirectly after having their own first real exposure to abject poverty even just a few mile from where they lived they were moved to make a difference to pour their energy every day into giving other people in their community better life cavin oginga from kenya a field ops manager for givedirectly who applied for a job there after running a research project on givedirectly s work for poverty action org and seeing what a massive impact they were having one of the most interesting story we heard wa about a young woman who received a cash transfer from givedirectly in 2014 she used a large portion of the transfer to cover her school fee so that she could complete her schooling and then graduated and immediately sought employment she applied to work for givedirectly gd often ha 200 600 applicant for any one vacancy and she got the job from living off of le than one dollar a day to now being employed in one of the most competitive role available the cash transfer from givedirectly ha completely altered the path of her life and she will reach height that only two year ago she would have thought to be completely unattainable for her 2 there wa really no savior barbie complex in the givedirectly operation no one is coming in from wealthy nation and telling anyone else how to live their own life and what s best for them and no one here is swooping in from some rich country on a self serving mission save the world 3 auditing the rigor behind this operation is crazy they have 5 separate team of people for each stage in the transfer process from initial outreach through final follow up the recipient almost never see the same people so there s no nepotism and absolutely everything is audited 4 let s face it data is boring and unsexy yet it s likely the most powerful foundation for any for profit or charitable organization to build upon givedirectly is almost annoying with how data centric they are every decision literally every single question we asked them about why they do or do not do something wa backed by data and we re not talking about just any old data we re talking about peer reviewed audited and randomized controlled trial rcts the holy grail of i m right and you re wrong not that they carry that swagger on their shoulder whatsoever i m humble bragging on their behalf but if they re doing something it s because their data and 3 other independent source data ha proven that s the right decision 5 the mission per se of how gd give isn t about funding what they believe will have the most profitable result rather funding is based on who ha the greatest need basically it s the ultimate anti ruthless capitalism i loved hearing that i e not favoring a 22 year old with a bunch of entrepreneurial idea over a 35 y o single mother of 4 richard aura ongari from homa bay kenya sits inside of the small two room mud hut that he build with part of his cash transfer from givedirectly the majority of his transfer ha been spent on medication for a chronic illness before being able to afford the medication richard could not walk but now that he s being treated you can find him marching all around his property and enjoying his life with his child and grandchild now for the meat of it we went into small kenyan village and met these people who ve taken a cash transfer of 1 000 3 installment over a year here s the breakdown of how their money wa spent 1 housing everyone that we met improved their housing situation in some way they were fixing the following core issue and fyi we didn t see a single home that wa larger than 20 foot by 20 foot that size home would house 5 9 people this small mud shack is home to 5 before receiving his 1 000 transfer from givedirectly samwel odhimbo orimba and his family lived homeless on the shore of lake victoria in homa bay kenya this house where you can see through the wall is a major upgrade for this incredibly grateful and loving family a thatched roof which leak in every rain and must be replaced every 1 3 year i completely sleepless night who can sleep getting rained on ii lead to frequent illness sometimes chronic and death iii lead to missed frequently school for child iv lead to missed work and income b no home living with 4 8 people in a 10x12 one or two room mud hut c upgrading home living in a mud hut with hole in the wall d dirt floor in home constant insect infestation including jigas which burrow in your foot causing crippling pain 2 school fee after primary school kenyan have to pay 60 70 per 3 month semester for school given that people in extreme poverty often earn le than 5 a day for a family of 2 4 kid that meager amount can be a mountain forcing thousand of kid to miss out on school from 5 or 6 year old and onwards 3 child of givedirectly recipient eunice awino omondi and 5 of their friend all living in siaya kenya where president obama s grandmother life eunice s child are now much healthier because they can sleep through the night under a steel roof and not thatched grass that keep them up and cold when it rain 3 food probably the saddest of expenditure in my opinion but a lot of people that we met were purchasing a few month s worth of corn to feed their family i see it a the saddest because such a basic need

may increase a person s propensity to seek these substance however there is no evidence that vice consumption is different from others in the community who did not receive transfer with gd s rigorous measurement and auditing they find the effect on vice spending tobacco alcohol etc is negative and insignificant meaning there is no statistically significant effect on vice consumption here is the 3rd party study conducted by princeton edu this finding is consistent with a publication from world bank on vice spending and cash transfer that surveyed dozen of study from around the world now this

johnson this post originally appeared on vice uk good cop bad war is the story of an undercover police officer neil wood who spent over a decade infiltrating britain s biggest drug gang the book released last week provides a unique insight into a world of mind game and violence where the drug trade act a a production line for the creation of ruthless gangster ultimately his experience led wood to reject the way drug are policed in the uk the logic of the drug war only lead one way the police get smarter so the criminal get nastier thing can only ever go from bad to worse from savagery to savagery say wood now after having left the force he is chairman of leap uk law enforcement against prohibition a pro drug legalization activist group consisting of ex law enforcement official but to what extent are wood and his colleague at leap uk and those currently employed in the police force rare specimen how thin on the ground are drug cop who think they are fighting the wrong fight expressing sympathy for anything other than hardline prohibition even to their colleague is something of a risk in the black and white them and u world of police culture even so every now and then drug cop open up about the reality of clearing the street of dealer and drug neil wood buying crack while undercover in 1995 photo courtesy of neil wood i spoke to mike fisher a senior drug investigator for britain s organized crime busting bureau the national crime agency nca he asked for his name to be changed to avoid disciplinary action a his view will definitely not be found anywhere near the page of the nca s annual report if the nca stopped targeting drug gang it would change nothing he explained you would see little change in the high street society would not collapse a it is drug are freely available now all that would happen is that dealing would be more open but it may give u more of a chance to deal with crime such a homicide on the surface it s a counter intuitive line to take for a senior officer working within an agency for which the drug trade is a key target law enforcement against drug is completely ineffective and ha been since the misuse of drug act came into force in 1971 say fisher the idea of the state protecting you from yourself just doesn t work we ve spent billion of pound trying to prohibit drug but there s le chance of it working than canute stopping the wave photo andoni lubaki fisher tell me that arresting people on the street for drug is an endless cycle and that it s the same with the larger fish whenever we remove a big guy someone else usually a lieutenant replaces him within day the more we try the harder it get increased enforcement keep these people looking over their shoulder they become more covert about their activity and that make our job harder fisher s solution is to take the portugal route decriminalize personal use of all drug from cannabis to heroin and look at legalizing production and supply i believe consenting adult have a choice a to what they put in their body it will also make it easier for heroin and crack user to get the help they need and free up police time to go out on patrol and deal with other crime he say ideally production should be wrested from organized criminal and managed by government surprisingly he tell me around half of britain s elite drug detective at nca have similar liberal attitude to the drug problem but what about those drug cop working below nca level in town and city across the uk to gauge what they truly think about their daily task you need to be a fly on the wall so that s the exact position that university of sheffield criminologist dr matthew bacon took he spent two year embedded with drug detective in a town and a major city the identity of which are secret in the uk and wrote about his experience in taking care of business published last month most officer were anti drug and fully supported prohibition drug were seen a being behind all that s bad in society this gave them a righteousness in their action observed bacon but within this recreational drug user social dealer and nightclub were far le of a crime problem than alcohol a drug which few officer had a problem with it s perhaps not surprising given the police s moral code that most of the officer he hung around with viewed junky a lazy undeserving scumbags in 2012 a former undercover officer who disguised himself a a heroin user dealer told me it made me realize how bad cop can be to drug addict i wa abused assaulted and threatened with being fitted up by having drug planted on me on a regular basis to the anti drug team bacon shadowed heroin dealer were one of the most despised group in society so much so that they were seen a police property object that police could do with a they wished almost without exception dealer were depicted a deplorable and dangerous outlaw say bacon they were made the scapegoat of the drug problem photo marco tulio valencia drug cop who saw themselves a elite crime fighter had sufficient respect however for the the mr bigs of the drug world they saw those who ran professional outfit and had family at home a worthy adversary and a good collar for which they would earn respect among their colleague despite all this there wa acceptance often expressed by officer off duty after a few pint that they were not waging a war on drug but managing an unbeatable problem in order to keep the public happy one detective sergeant told bacon sometimes i think we re like those japanese soldier in world war ii you know those one on the island who just kept fighting because they didn t know the war wa over only difference is we d lost the war before we even started fighting another officer told him we ve thrown everything at it even the kitchen sink but drug problem just keep getting worse in the end the drug are still on the street no matter how many people we lock up there are rebellious notion even among the rank and file when i went stop and searching in soho with one of the met police s sniffer dog team in 2013 i wa surprised to hear from a regular beat officer and his colleague that they thought cannabis should be legalized entirely i say legalize the lot one said legalize it and tax it said the other if someone want to turn the sky green and the grass blue then it s up to them i can t see the difference between alcohol and cannabis the official line is that drug are under control but they are not i call up simon kempton a police sergeant from dorset who ha specialized in drug enforcement and sits on the national board of the police federation a body that represents rank and file officer he agrees with wood that the drug trade house the most violent people in the country but belief prohibition is crucial to taking them out i can t speak for everyone but in my opinion drug policing is worthwhile all day every day he say i get it it can seem futile when we take out someone knocking out kilo of cocaine who s replaced within two hour but the reason it s worth doing is because the drug is not just about the drug trade it s weapon terrorism people trafficking money laundering it straddle the spectrum of the most serious crime such a murder kidnapping serious assault which all go hand in hand with the drug trade we are taking out the worst people in our society when they assault people it s not just a punch up outside a pub we are talking about sending a message through retribution and torture these people have to protect their trade from others so they use extreme level of violence you have to be the scariest biggest person on the block otherwise they will take your money from you undercover police officer would not take the huge risk infiltrating gang if they did not think it wa worthwhile undercover drug policing is not cheap but it s very cost effective it s rare to get a not guilty after undercover work because of all the evidence that s been gathered yes people can feel demoralized that they ve put themselves on the line and then someone end up getting just a coupe of year but that s the way it is sometimes however sgt kempton said that for rank and file officer policing cannabis wa another matter and that many officer sympathized with the path taken by durham police in going easy on low level cannabis offense with dwindling resource force are having to focus their limited number on area which represent the greatest harm to wider society while policing cannabis is still a legitimate action i believe most officer and the public would support a focus on other area of crime over the year writing about the drug trade i ve met drug cop who have told me that their job is similar to that of the drug user or trafficker a series of almost addictive drug bust hit that perpetuate the game there are some who have crossed the line completely to become dependent drug user themselves and others who are disgusted by the stigmatization of drug user and even dealer one female drug cop i spoke to told me there are some pretty nasty piece of work out there but some of them are just ordinary people behind every user and runner there s a story she said a lot of people say drug addict and drug dealer are scum of the earth but they don t know anything about them wood book will open the public s eye to the raw violence and canniness of the drug world and the length police will go to in order to disrupt it but after year fighting at the apex of the drug war his conclusion and that of other experienced officer who have chosen to speak out must be heeded if we want to find a solution to a problem that ha been trashing community around the world for decade", "question": "british police officer reveal what they really think about the

in the dna of a killer i first learned about the 20 year old murder of angie dodge in a roundabout way after getting my dna analyzed by one of those commercial dna database when i got my result back i wa not surprised there were no big revelation and just a i suspected i am not related to royalty but i did wonder if i could learn anything more from the dna report that search sent me down a rabbit hole that lead me to the story of michael usry jr a young filmmaker who became a suspect in the angie dodge murder investigation after getting my dna report i learned that there are a number of genealogy site educational institution and company that are willing to offer you further insight into what your dna may reveal a long a you re willing to upload your dna profile to them some of these site charge money while others are simply willing to analyze your dna profile in exchange for adding your profile to their database i probably uploaded my profile to about four site one told me the type of workout supplement i should be taking another searched public family tree for family connection there wa even one that promised to create a diet tailor made for me based on my dna i gave no thought to how my profile could be used by these company or institution down the road then i heard that the new york city police department wa trying to get permission to do something called a familial dna search what doe that mean police hunting for a killer in a high profile murder case wanted to use his dna to search new york state s criminal database for a relative of his they had already searched for the killer but he wa not in the database if they could find someone related to him they would have a family name making it easier to track down the killer a quick search of the phrase familial dna and i learned authority in california had used it to apprehend a serial killer who had eluded them for 25 year the infamous grim sleeper lonny franklin jr had a son who wa serving time on a felony weapon charge and his dna had been uploaded to the california criminal database a familial search connected father and son allowing police to finally make an arrest a little more searching and i stumbled across a blog post about a young filmmaker named michael usry jr a familial search conducted by idaho fall police landed usry in a stark interrogation room where he wa grilled by detective and asked for his dna without any explanation i tracked usry down on facebook and asked him to call me when we finally spoke he told the whole story how his father had participated in a genealogical study through their church giving a sample of his dna to a public database which wa later purchased by ancestry com year later in an attempt to crack the 20 year old cold case murder of angie dodge police conducted a familial dna search in that very database and found an anonymous donor who appeared to be a very close match to the killer s dna after obtaining a search warrant for ancestry com to reveal his name detective learned it wa a man named michael usry sr when cop built out his family tree they found usry had a son cop tracked him down and began investigating a i talked with michael usry he told me he wa very angry about being caught up in the investigation but he wa even angrier about something else there wa a man serving time for angie s murder christopher tapp who usry belief is innocent after i hung up the phone i started researching angie dodge s murder and the case against chris tapp i learned that authority had never found tapp s dna at the crime scene tapp wa convicted and had at that point served nearly 20 year because of his own word a confession he made to police i wa immediately struck by the fact that michael usry jr and chris tapp had found themselves in similar situation 20 year apart both men said they knew nothing about the murder of angie dodge both men had their dna tested and both men did not match that of the killer yet one man went to prison and the other man went home that wa the story i pitched to 48 hour executive producer susan zirinsky chris tapp serving time for the murder of idaho teen angie dodge show cbs news correspondent anne marie green what his life is like inside the the day both michael usry and i went to see chris tapp in prison i wa struck by how soft spoken and kind tapp wa he cried twice that day once when i asked about the moment in his interrogation when he began to implicate himself in angie s murder and a second time when michael usry showed him a video of something that wa shot for a documentary usry is making about this case it wa an interview with tapp s wife lori who tapp had met and married while in prison in the video lori spoke of how much she admired her husband and believed in his innocence the interview wa conducted shortly before lori wa killed in a car crash and this wa the first time tapp had heard her voice since the accident i think there are many lesson in this case but writing strictly a it relates to the privacy of dna database the lesson is this when you trade your dna for information you are also giving it away and the database you give it to owns it what if that company go out of business and sell the database do the protection you have been promised still stand what if an insurance company want to know if you carry a specific gene that could increase your chance of getting cancer or indicates a penchant for risk taking right now the judicial system is playing catch up when it come to your right and protection so we should all be aware and read the fine print there is nothing wrong with wanting to know where you came from and what your gene can tell you about your health just make sure you know what you are signing up for

market value is now trading at negative yield meaning that buyer are willing to pay more for these bond than they will eventually get back if they hold them to maturity this is remarkable country like germany have been selling short and midterm debt at negative yield for a while but now it s happening with bond dated for 10 year or longer investor are basically banging down the door for the guarantee that they will only lose a little bit of money over the next decade or two the most mind blowing example of this trend is switzerland last week yield on all of it government bond out to 50 year turned negative investor are now expected to pay for the privilege of lending money to the swiss for a half century at a time other country are getting nearly a good deal fifteen year german and japanese bond yield have also drifted below zero even economically wounded spain can borrow for a few year at a time and theoretically make a profit it s like a bad financial world play on a yakov smirnoff joke in switzerland lender pay you why are investor settling for these kind of term for one they don t see many other safe option the world economy still feel shaky especially after the brexit vote which sent bond yield even lower meanwhile stashing cash in a vault somewhere cost money and effort you need to cover the cost of security and storage so they re willing to pay government to essentially hold their euro or yen or swiss franc the fact that long dated bond are going negative also mean that the market don t expect inflation to rise much down the line which mean they don t expect world growth to pick up much either it may even be a sign that some investor see deflation on the horizon since a bond with a negative yield could theoretically be profitable if price fall enough in a country all of which is to say today s sub zero bond yield are a sign of how deeply pessimistic investor have become about both the near and somewhat distant future and if they stay down they could create some nasty problem of their own when long term interest rate fall too low for instance it make it very hard for bank to earn a profit by borrowing and lending this is playing out all over but right now people are looking very nervously at italy s bank in particular which are parched for profit while sitting on a pile of bad loan a matt o brien note at the washington post low bond yield around the world can make it hard for central bank to ever raise rate since the second they do investor will rush to buy that government s bond among other thing that can push up the value of a

rcp to conclude it s probably time to panic i d disagree for those concerned about the prospect of a trump victory it s been time to panic for a while zooming out from a single statistic show it delayed panic although this might be the first time that trump ha come out on top in the rcp polling average he ha come very close to doing so on two prior occasion in september and december of last year since september clinton s lead ha fluctuated significantly from being a large a 11 percentage point to a narrow a 0 6 in other word there have been many other period when trump s opponent should have been worrying before now just a it took pundit a while to wake up to the fact that trump wa a sufficiently popular candidate to win the republican nomination it seems that they have also been slow to switch focus to his chance of winning the white house part of the reason why they didn t panic before wa a belief that measuring american public opinion a long time before a national election is a bad predictor of voting pattern why because people change their mind november is still six month away the alternative view is that preference may be becoming hardened now making voter behavior le likely to shift looking backward rather than forward result from the last six presidential election suggest that 31 state are safe based on the fact that the same party ha consistently won them unsurprisingly polling company are investing their time and resource in state they think might swing and therefore determine electoral outcome nationally state like arizona florida north carolina ohio and west virginia so far polling suggests neither candidate ha a significant lead in those state which could provide extra cause for concern for those worrying about a trump win polling on a pedestal all that said the rcp polling average is not the perfect political barometer it is so often held up to be the polling average ha become the go to number for those trying to make quick sense of the state of the presidential race that s problematic in itself this election can t be predicted on the basis of just one number not least because a candidate s vote share doe not neatly translate to their chance of winning the white house each state wields a different number of electoral vote so it matter how a candidate s support is distributed throughout the country democratic victory in highly populous state which have more electoral vote to award could cause the performance of the democratic candidate in the electoral college to outstrip her or his performance in the popular vote in 2008

doubt that if daniel radcliffe were a rock musician his current press tour for kill your darling would have a title like the moving on tour 13 or harry in the rearview mirror yes daniel radcliffe is no longer harry potter a a recent new york time magazine profile deftly illustrated but what s interesting about radcliffe great even is that he s not anti harry potter here s your for instance in kill your darling radcliffe play a young allen ginsberg who at the outset of the beat generation find his friend lucien carr dane dehaan embroiled in a scandalous relationship that lead to tragedy when i pointed out that the ginsberg wasn t exactly a connoisseur of mainstream taste radcliffe defended the harry potter franchise the 24 year old may be moving on from hogwarts but he certainly hasn t forgotten nor dismissed where he came from not only do you have kill your darling coming out this year but you also starred in the toronto international film festival debut horn and the f word it s not easy to redefine yourself from harry potter but it appears it s happening i think it depends on the attitude you take towards it basically if you say yes potter wa the biggest thing that i m ever going to do and i m never going to come close to that again and it s going to hold me back from getting part then probably all of those thing will come true but if you take the attitude that this is the most amazing platform in a way to get set for a career in the world it s an amazing start to have had and it s something that can be capitalized on rather than being something that hold you back and i just have such fun doing my job a well like the most interesting way for me to do it is by picking diverse varied thing like the f word and kill your darling and i think there s definitely an element of you grow up for 10 year on a set and you don t really have peer when you re 12 or 13 that you look to in other film when you re 16 or 17 you start becoming aware of guy like aaron johnson or eddie redmayne or ben whishaw or james mcavoy and you start being fan of them and you also start kind of going oh i want to do what they re doing i want to have load of different part a well so it build up this desire to get out there the woman in black felt like it narrative wa basically here s daniel radcliffe s first post potter role and now with these people have moved on i think that s a really astute observation i think that s completely true the woman in black wa a fantastic transition because it wasn t so different than harry that people were like oh he s just trying to shock u but it wa different enough that people realized it wa a different reason to go and see it and the fact that it did so well and it wa a really good movie i may not be over the moon with my own performance in it there s still stuff i see when i see that that s very reminiscent of harry i only started filming it six week or something after we finished the last potter so it came very soon after but i do think now with these next three film people will see it is so different from anything i ve done before i just think i ve grown up a lot a an actor in the last couple of year and i think a a consequence my work s gotten better and i m just looking forward to people finally seeing it because i feel like i ve been talking about this film for age and now people will get to verify for themselves and you re playing a guy who is part of a group that despises mainstream taste laugh yes yeah i know what you mean but you know i think that s what i liked about potter and that s what i m still very proud of about potter even though it wa the most commercial series in the world in term of the money it made and the appeal it had we always did try to make them a challenging a possible i think the reason i m so proud of it still is that we made eight film that got better and better and better until the last one that s not very often achieved in film and the fact we achieved it is a testament to the amount of care and love put into it by everyone who wa involved on that set all the time so yeah i still think we did a remarkable thing and even if we were very mainstream which of course we were we brought a lot of integrity and sort of a boldness to the franchise because when i wa growing up i don t remember people talking about franchise before i wa in one i remember people talking about lord of the ring and potter would be like franchise that s the first time i remember last time we spoke you mentioned you had never watched star war yes well except for the phantom menace let s not tell anyone that you have to catch up before episode vii come out i know i know i do i have to catch up before that because fucking all of my friend are working on the new one because star war is filming in leavesden there wa at least one guy digby milner who worked on all the potter who had also worked on star war the original and he will be working on new star war at leavesdon a well and it is kind of amazing because star war the original were made in england a well so there s a lot of that crew who we ll basically have a huge amount of son and daughter of the original crew who are now on the new star war movie it s come full circle that s all they do at leavesdon apparently is franchise laugh kill your darling is interesting because it involves famous people in a story that s really not that well known i mean i didn t know the story at all i really wasn t aware of it that s one of the thing that s so cool about it and cool about reading the script for the first time is you just go wow when you have a story that is this fascinating about a group of character that is this well known and yet this story ha really never been told you start of just feel like this is buried treasure we ve struck allen ginsberg wanted to write a book about this at one point and he wa told not to absolutely lucien for reason you understand when you see the film did not want anyone to know this story but i definitely think that wa one of the fascinating thing about it people didn t know and one of the thing i think people will like about this film that i think perhaps they won t expect is that when you hear 1940s beat poet historical drama you sort of think oh that sound quite dry but it s actually a lot of fun a well i don t think you can make a movie about the beat without having fun because they had a great fucking time this might be a bad comparison but it s got a superhero origin story feel to it only with writer oh i ve said that a lot like when we re introduced to jack kerouac it felt dramatic and the first time we see allen s name in the film is on his university application director john krokidas loved the idea of taking this famous person s name but actually seeing it in the context of them applying to university what wa your reaction when you heard j k rowling wa revisiting the harry potter universe with fantastic beast where to find them were you surprised i had never heard her say no i don t think any of u would ever be foolish enough to you know say never but i think with jo i wasn t really surprised it kind of made sense to me actually when it wa announced because i wa kind of like ok yeah she s gone off and had casual vacancy and then done the robert galbraith book and both have been very successful and i imagine that ha given her a confidence of oh ok now that i stepped away from it i can actually go back to it with confidence and i think she recognizes that there is still a huge hunger out there for more side of the potter world and yeah she s want to give people what they want and i think it will be really good i m just relieved that it s in her hand to be honest that let me know that it s not anyone just cashing in

refugee the conclusion of the study wa that child who identified with harry a a character reacted to his sympathy for marginalized group such a mudbloods by becoming more sympathetic towards similar group in contemporary society such a the lgbt and immigrant community but this wa only shown after these connection were explicated to the child and only if they identified with harry what doe this all mean sure we create image in our head of the story we read we engage with language we sympathize with the character in our book but besides harry potter which book should we be reading to maximize these cognitive benefit the author of another study david comer kidd and emanuele castano tackled this question but also asserted that what you choose read is important a castano explained to mic com we believe that one critical difference between lit and pop fiction is the extent to which the character are complex ambiguous difficult to get to know etc in other word human versus stereotyped simple through their research they found that reader of literary fiction receive more of the empathetic benefit of reading than those who read pop fiction or non fiction the term literary fiction seems arbitrary but kidd and castano explain that literary fiction merely denotes the level of complexity in story and their character at least that s what it mean in the context of their study in 50 shade of grey for example the character are laid out they react to each other and to their environment by no mean are these character simple or easy but they do not evoke the same complicated and uncanny feeling that one experience with nick carraway a he narrates the great gatsby reading in general help with empathy but literary reading amplifies this effect by reading a challenging book you re not only becoming a smarter person you re also become more empathetic literature is not always easy but by attempting to tackle harder book we create new connection in our mind that we might not

fsb agent passing urine sample back and forth through a hole in a wall hidden behind a cabinet in a laboratory and everything kinda sorta maybe tie back to putin because then you d be absolutely right this morning the court of arbitration for sport made a ruling on russia s cartoonish state sponsored skullduggery which ha been going on since 2010 it upheld the international association of athletic federation ban on russian track and field athlete in the rio olympics whether there s hard evidence they were juicing or not the international olympics committee is still making up it mind about that ban but it s also still possible it will ban the country altogether a decision that would affect not just the medal count in rio but the state of international athletics marcus noland executive vice president and director of study at the peterson institute for international economics build model that forecast medal count based on past performance population gdp and other variable in london the russian won four to 16 more medal than his model predicted meaning their win were probably inflated by doping and his number have been borne out the olympic committee ha since reallocated 11 russian medal from the london game if the russian competed in rio cleanly or a noland say no dirtier than average his model suggest they re good for 66 or 67 medal so how many more would he expect if doping went on unchecked if they managed to nab 11 extra medal in london when their doping program wa still relatively new you can bet they could get at least that number and then some noland figure the russian would have come away with about 80 medal if the ioc doe ban russia that s enough medal to throw any olympic prediction seriously out of whack and many of the medal that might have otherwise gone to russian athlete would likely go to competitor from the u a they did at the 1984 los angeles olympics that the soviet union boycotted in the absence of the ussr the u s total medal count skyrocketed to 174 and fell to 94 when the soviet returned to the olympics in 1988 for the olympic movement it s a huge deal say david wallechinsky the president of the international society of olympic historian this isn t tonga or paraguay it s one of three big medal winner for the average american olympics viewer the absence of russian athlete might go unnoticed where it most certainly will be noticed of course is russia you cannot separate the olympics from politics say wallechinsky that s a myth russia is already saying this a western plot country have been banned from the olympics before but it s always been for overtly political reason germany and japan were not on the olympic guest list for the 1948 summer olympics south africa wa banned during the apartheid era and afghanistan wa banned in 2000 the potential russian ban wouldn t be that much of a departure from those decision because olympic athlete doping is inherently political if doping is done for the glory of the nation state even if the athlete is doing it in secret with just an internet connection and a po box it can take on an element of politics say john gleaves co director of the international network of humanistic doping research and state sponsored doping is the same but you know more so one of the reason that doping ha remained such a problem at the olympics is that the whole process is completely byzantine and country are left to police themselves the anti doping setup had led to a really lumpy enforcement say gleaves how much anti doping work can kenya be expected to do when you look at it ranking in gdp the russian doping scandal put a spotlight on a problem that wa already systemic in international sport which may very well drive the ioc to be a stickler for the sake of it

pregnant woman if her baby is kicking and she want you to have a feel she ll invite you to 2 don t ask if she ha chosen a name this might not seem like a big deal but it can be to those who haven t thought of a name yet or those that have but feel that they might be bombarded with judgmental opinion gone are the day when we would name our child john or jane in recent time there s been a general trend to more creative name such a wolf or apple problem arise when she tell you what she s going to name her child and you can t resist sharing all your opinion on why this is a good or bad decision hearing opinion from everyone else is stressful for mother to be it s easier to not ask about the name and just wait for her to announce it once the baby is born i ve found that all child seem to perfectly fit their name in time even if it might sound a strange or unusual name at first 3 don t look shocked when you hear she s pregnant this often happens with woman i see who are also in high

most clueless comment that annoy pregnant woman come from people subtly judging them for packing on pregnancy pound a pregnant woman is aware that she is growing so there s no need to be constantly reminding her that she s huge big or massive even if she s looking a large she doesn t need to hear it 5 don t tell her she s not big enough following on from the previous comment it is also not nice to tell someone they look small or ask them are you gaining enough weight you may think you re paying a mama to be a compliment when you say you re so tiny or i can barely see your belly but you may only be making her worry about the development and growth of her baby 6 don t congratulate her on social medium if someone tell you they re pregnant they have chosen to tell you and not your friend

a while back and now he ha some thought to share about the new feature that have been added to the recently released freebsd 10 3 jesse smith report for distrowatch freebsd is a venerable operating system often deployed on server due to the project s focus on performance and stability at the beginning of april the freebsd project released version 10 3 of their operating system the release announcement for freebsd 10 3 mentioned several feature and improvement which caught my attention specifically the availability of zfs boot environment 64 bit linux compatibility and jail improvement were of interest to me i wa especially eager to try out freebsd s new jail technology using the iocage front end the iocage software ha been presented a an improvement on and replacement for warden a friendly front end for handling jail environment one of the first thing i wanted to do wa experiment with boot environment for those who have not used them before a boot environment is basically a snapshot of our operating system before performing any major configuration change or software upgrade we can take a snapshot of the operating system this give u a point in time when we knew the operating system wa working we then perform any change or upgrade we want when we boot the system we can choose from the boot menu which snapshot we want to use this allows u to effectively move backward in time and boot older copy of the system this make the operating system virtually bullet proof a almost any change short of hardware failure can be fixed by simply rebooting and selecting to boot an older copy of the operating system the pc bsd and opensuse project have used boot environment successfully for some time now but the technology ha not widely caught on elsewhere the next item on my list of thing to try wa 64 bit linux compatibility freebsd ha a compatibility layer which allows the operating system to run linux executables there are some restriction though for example up until now the linux executable had to be compiled for 32 bit system and any dependency had to be copied into place manually there is a package in the freebsd repository which installs the centos core userland software in essence this give u a bare bone installation of centos 6 in a directory on our freebsd computer this is handy if we need to run linux software alongside freebsd software or if we want to run linux software without the resource overhead of a full featured virtual machine the final feature i wanted to look at wa freebsd jail specifically the way the iocage software work and how it compare to the older warden jail management software jail on freebsd are basically very lightweight virtual machine part of the file system is roped off and process can run in this area jail without knowing about or being able to affect the rest of the system what primarily separate jail from virtual machine is jail all share the host s kernel meaning jailed process must be able to run on

sinister guide for men on how to talk to woman wearing headphone ha outraged many here s a more honest and accurate guide an article ha surfaced from the quagmire of bilge that is the internet and it ha caused not without reason a small tornado of outrage written a dating advice for the modern man a misnomer if ever there were one it promise a solution to the hot n horny down on their luck young buck of the world who face the tedious obstacle of a woman wearing headphone because how dare she and no it isn t a parody you can read it in it full entitled glory or stick with me a i dissect each grubby jaw dropping delusion of psychopathic awfulness it s going to be quite a ride how to talk to a woman who is wearing headphone these day many woman walk around playing with a smartphone or tablet device and are often wearing headphone and listening to music at the same time yet that doesn t mean you can t talk to them of course not all woman are open to being approached because not all woman are single and looking however if a woman wearing headphone is single and hoping to meet a boyfriend or even a new lover she will almost always be happy to take off her headphone to give you an opportunity to create a spark with her the author one dan bacon could have saved u all a lot of bother here by answering his how to with don t sadly he seems to have missed some basic behavioural science here you see the very reason i and many other woman wear headphone isn t a a trivial obstacle to some throbbing hormone mountain nor a a challenge for those blessed with an abundance of ego it s a defence a defence against the aural onslaught of modern life and especially the leering advance of said throbbing hormone mountain in short we wear them because we don t want to be talked to it s basic physic really we fill our ear hole to stop you from getting in but back to dan what to do to get her attention 1 stand in front of her with 1 to 1 5 meter between you 2 have a relaxed easy going smile 3 is she hasn t already looked up at you simply get her attention with a wave of your hand wave your hand in her direct line of vision so she can t ignore it 4 when she look at you smile and point to her headphone and say take off your headphone for a minute and pretend to be taking headphone off your head so she fully understands if she doesn t understand most woman will simply gesture that you want to talk to her by briefly pointing back and forth from you to her and say i want to talk to you for a minute in most case you won t have to go to that extreme but some girl are shy and will be hesitant to take the headphone off right away because they are feeling a lot of nervousness and excitement about what is happening 5 then do what we call acknowledging the awkwardness by quickly mentioning something about the awkwardness of the moment see the conversation example below to demonstrate you understand that approaching a woman in this way isn t the most common of experience for either party this help put her at ease and know that you are a cool guy who she can relax and open up to i don t know if these five step are a common thing but i have personally experienced this several time at step 1 i know what you are doing and i m ignoring you hoping the ground will open up and take one of u to the depth of somewhere hellish which would be more pleasant than this situation is developing to be by step 3 i m not feeling excited and i m not feeling flattered a dan later tell his reader i will be i m feeling harassed straight up dictionary definition harassed by step 4 i ve learnt that you can t understand a basic body language brush off and are therefore a direct threat to my personal safety my brain is in fight or flight checking for escape route it s trying to figure out just how aggressively you re going to react to any further action i take to extract myself from a situation entirely not of my own making and it is praying they use a flattering photo of me on the news not that one when my front facing camera went off accidentally that time according to step 5 the fact you have bullied me into one of the most awkward and scary moment of my life make you a cool guy mr bacon clearly ha trouble spelling it begin with a t dan here s dan s interpretation of how the conversation go once a man ha used his infallible five point jedi mind trick to bludgeon a woman from her blissful state of aural security you smile in a friendly confident manner hey i know it s not normal for people to talk to someone with headphone in but i wa walking along and saw you and thought wow she s a cutie i have to say hi i m dan what s your name woman usually flattered by the compliment and impressed by your confidence to approach her like that jessica you add in some humor cool nice to meet you jessica i don t normally talk to girl with headphone but your big green headphone were just calling out to me woman most likely laughing smiling and enjoying the interaction you let her know that you have something to do somewhere to go so she understands that you re not going to stand there talking to her for 30 minute anyway so i m just out doing a bit of shopping at the moment i m on my way to a store up the street how s your day going so far in his scenario jessica ha just been waiting her whole life to be blessed with the attention of a complete stranger who mistake hunched shoulder darting eye and rictus for laughing and smiling here s how it play out in real life trust me i ve been it seen it and spoken to the survivor him i see you don t want to be talked to but i find you physically attractive and i m making that your problem her please leave me alone him f you you stuck up b i didn t fancy you anyway with advice like this out there it s hardly any surprise is it these lonely men so desperately in search of conquest have been given permission blessed with the entitlement to go forth and pluck their bounty using but five humble step so imagine their horror and indignation when that which ha been promised doesn t want to be plucked and tell them to sling their greasy hook next dan list the five mistake men make when approaching a woman who is wearing headphone sadly not one of them is to sod right off point 1 4 and 5 are fairly inoffensive generic dating guff be confident be engaging be flirty but oh boy just try and get your noggin round point 2 and 3 2 allowing her to ignore him headphone are a great barrier between a person and the rest of the world that being said if a guy want to get a woman s attention he need to show confidence by being determined to get her to stop listening to the music and chat to him to him if a guy ha a weak vibe or presence about him a woman usually won t give in to his request for her to remove the headphone woman love to test guy to see how confident they really are and a favorite test of woman is to ignore a guy s attempt to converse with her and see what he will do next will he walk away in shame or will he remain calm and continue talking to her in a confident easy going manner this is her way of gauging his interest in her and also a way of determining whether he is mentally and emotionally strong enough for a girl like her if a guy give up at the first sign of resistance most woman will be turned off by his mental and emotional weakness a a man 3 allowing her to take control of the interaction no matter how confident or challenging a woman might behave she still dream of meeting a guy who is more confident than her a woman doesn t want to be forced to control an interaction with a guy i e call the shot bos him around but she will if she ha to controlling an interaction with a woman is not about bossing her around being arrogant or being too assertive instead you simply need to assume the role of the man and let her be the woman in other word make her feel girly around you because you think behave and feel your vibe so masculine the advice here is basically no doesn t mean no it mean keep going until you get what you want the screaming will stop eventually because apparently that s what woman want and form the basis for a million rape defence case trust me when we tell you to go away we aren t testing your measure a a man we re testing how quickly your leg can carry you in an offward direction put dan s advice into any other scenario for the true jaw drop factor shopkeeper may lock their door at night but if you want a pint of milk just hammer on the door until they open up they ll be flattered i appreciate the world of mating is hard but please for the love of humanity learn this just because you want doesn t mean you can have woman are not commodity to be hunted and won and if you have no luck finding someone to bump pink bit with that s your problem not our fault for not adhering to the playbook rule it s a playbook we never signed up for and it s only a game if both team actually know they re playing nowhere in his advice doe dan tell his frustrated man baby how to handle rejection with grace because the advice is simply not to accept it this attitude is why i and countless other woman have been been chased down the street followed home physically restrained spat at verbally abused and generally made to feel like garbage merely for trying to exist so when i hear the whiny pissbabies ask when am i allowed to approach hot single woman simple if a woman ha her headphone in the answer is never and before you bleat on about ooh what if there s a fire she ll smell it even through all your bull t if you re in a bar or party her flirtatious smile may be the come on you re looking for but be prepared to accept that you read it wrong politely wish her a good evening and toddle back off out of her life without 20 minute of awkward pawing insisting she let you buy her a rohypnoltini but how about this take up a hobby ask your friend if they know of someone looking to date or brace yourself for a whopper of a revelation if you re looking for a horde of single eligible woman all looking for friendship maybe more in one convenient place try a dating site anyway

planet wide alien conspiracy she can kick serious butt when the situation dictate but she s also known to stop and photograph the fauna when she ha a free moment the game wa originally planned to be the first installment of a trilogy but poor sale put a wrench in those gear still the game wa well received by critic and a cult fan base ha been vocal enough that a sequel wa announced in 2008 in the year since an hd remake of the original came out in 2011 but we haven t heard much about the purported sequel is it still in the work will it really see the light of day we may have a while more to wait before we know for sure when we might see it ubisoft maintains that this game is in development and will be released sometime this console generation according to one rumor it could be an nx exclusive 4 kingdom heart 3 for a certain segment of fan the kingdom heart game are a dream come true they combine beloved disney character with fan favorite from square enix s final fantasy series if you happen to fit into the target audience chance are you re well aware of this long running series the original kingdom heart came out for playstation 2 in 2002 and ha seen seven sequel in the interim so it s kind of strange that the series hasn t managed to produce a third official installment instead sticking to prequels remake and some would say filler never fear a third installment is on it way and it s coming only to playstation 4 and xbox one no release date ha been set but have faith that this one will actually happen when we might see it hopefully by 2017 3 final fantasy xv fun fact the game that s currently called final fantasy xv began under the title final fantasy xiii versus which wa first shown to the public way back in 2006 here we are closing in on a decade later and this game still hasn t made it to market what s going on well final fantasy once the leading series of japanese role playing game ha fallen on somewhat hard time the 13th installment in particular didn t exactly light the world on fire in fact most fan of the series would agree that it s been a slow downhill slide since final fantasy x came out in 2001 developer square enix is looking to fix that tarnished reputation by releasing a big important game for the series 15th installment and judging by the trailer and the demo that released alongside final fantasy type o hd they re on the right track will the finished product live up to expectation for that we ll have to wait and see when we might see it november 29 2016 2 the last guardian many longtime playstation gamers have a strong

off it s a terrific series of shooter that tell a great story in fact the series really laid the groundwork for all story based shooter to come it s no stretch to say that the original half life wa probably the first shooter to tell a story worth following at all making matter worse however is that the last installment half life 2 episode two which came out in 2007 ended on a major cliffhanger but instead of continuing that series and playing off that story s big ol hanging thread valve shifted it effort to the also excellent portal series by now the demand for half life 3 ha reached such a

it last week a department of agriculture report revealed just how much it really cost to shop organic organic egg milk and salad green can cost upwards of 60 percent more than conventional alternative while item like apple carrot granola and spinach carry premium of between 7 and 30 percent the study said producing organic food tends to be costlier along every part of the supply chain including farming practice that usually require greater labor input and segregating organic ingredient from conventional one though there may be logical reason for the heftier price tag doe it really make sense a a consumer to pay more for organic food the answer it turn out is anything but straightforward here we explore this hotly contested issue what the heck doe organic mean anyway organic produce according to the usda must be grown without synthetic pesticide synthetic fertilizer or genetically modified organism organic meat ha to come from animal that were raised in a natural setting didn t receive any antibiotic or hormone and were fed 100 percent organic feed by this general definition organic food should be friendlier to the planet and pose le harm to human health chensheng lu an associate professor of environmental exposure biology at harvard university told the huffington post over email when it come to packaged food only a label that say 100 percent organic indicates a product made solely with organic ingredient organic on the other hand mean 95 percent of the ingredient are organic while made with organic ingredient is reserved for product with at least 70 percent certified organic ingredient there s skepticism among consumer however about the trustworthiness of organic label last year a study by market research firm mintel found that a majority of american consumer think organic labeling is merely an excuse to charge more indeed there s some evidence that organic label may not always be reliable a major issue expert say is a lack of a robust monitoring system to keep track of whether product that say they re organic really are still despite a flawed system there do appear to be measurable difference between food labeled organic and those that are not a 2012 meta analysis published in the annals of internal medicine comparing organic and conventional food for example found that exposure to pesticide residue wa more than five time higher in conventional produce a 2014 study found that organic food had significantly lower level of toxic metal compared to conventional alternative and substantially higher level of antioxidant so what doe this mean for human health according to the environmental working group nearly three quarter of 7 000 produce sample tested by the usda in 2014 contained pesticide residue in some case these pesticide persisted on fruit and vegetable even when they were washed or peeled pesticide exposure ha been linked to all kind of health condition from neurodegenerative disease like parkinson s to cancer and birth defect the jury however is still out a to whether or not the pesticide found in conventional food are present in large enough quantity to actually make a difference to human health in the 2012 meta analysis conventional fruit and vegetable were found to have far more pesticide residue than organic produce but the level were almost always under the maximum amount allowed by the environmental protection agency we re exposed to a cocktail of chemical from our food on a daily basis said michael crupain the director of consumer report food safety and sustainability center in an earlier post it s not realistic to expect we wouldn t have any pesticide in our body in this day and age but that would be the ideal we just don t know enough about the health effect some organic food skeptic have also pointed out that non synthetic pesticide are used on some organic farm a well and the science is still hazy a to whether or not those compound have ill effect when it come to the nutritional value of organic food there s also conflicting data the 2012 meta analysis did not find any significant nutritional difference between conventional and organic food a meta analysis published two year later in the british journal of nutrition however found that organic produce may have substantially higher concentration of antioxidant and other potentially beneficial compound a recent study published in february concluded that organic dairy and meat contain about 50 percent more omega 3 fatty acid omega 3 are linked to reduction in cardiovascular disease improved neurological development and function and better immune function wrote study co author chris seal a professor of food and human nutrition at the u k s newcastle university but getting enough in our diet is difficult our study suggests that switching to organic would go some way towards improving intake of these important nutrient a for antibiotic use in food animal the problem are more clear cut the center for disease control note that s cientists around the world have provided strong evidence that antibiotic use in food producing animal can have a negative impact on public health because the drug allow antibiotic resistant bacteria to develop so choosing organic meat or meat raised without antibiotic is better than conventional when it come to this issue other way of measuring worth when considering the benefit of organic food it can be tempting to focus on the impact of such product on human health but a marion nestle author of food politics and professor of nutrition at new york university noted

premiered at this year s sundance film festival the dark comedy need a better adjective than dark because most of the film reveals deeply rooted sadness disappointment and failure carried out to

happen how surfing keep him from getting a little screwy and why he refused to be in front of the camera this time warning plot spoiler throughout when did you originally come across the material for god s pocket i read the book by pete dexter about 10 year ago and tried to get the right to it but it s a good thing i didn t get the right because i probably wouldn t be able to actually make a good movie then i tried getting the right but someone else owned them so i let it go about five year later someone reminded me of it and asked whatever happened to that book turn out the right were then available so i said all right i m going to outline this thing because i had written a shitty screenplay in between and i didn t want to do that again i did an outline about 100 page long and kind of just dumped everything from the book into it i said okay let s go get the right and then they came back to u and said that they had made a mistake the right were not available same people still owned it after you had put all that time into it i wa making the adjustment bureau at the time and wa sitting in a trailer for a large chunk of the day so it wa like are you going to watch tv or do this when i wa told i couldn t have it i thought well if they have owned this thing for so long and haven t done anything with it i m just going to write it anyway and if someone else make it first fine eventually bob gersh from the gersh agency worked out the deal do you think it made the project that much more appealing because you couldn t have it at first it sort of alleviated the pressure of a production deal or deadline in a way when you re sitting around like actor do and you start to go crazy because you need an outlet i would do this at the end of the day i d put in a few hour and crank it around a little bit and i wouldn t feel crazy that day do you have a different itch that s satisfied by writing versus acting it s the same if i were acting in a play or directing creative people go on vacation and four day in you re like i gotta get out of here i have a lot of energy so i m told i surf a lot you live in l a half the time for mad men we re in new york so i have a place i go surfing in long island isn t that freezing in the winter it is but there s all kind of gear now it s like skiing almost if i sit around and do nothing for a while i get a little screwy what did you find most compelling about the material in god s pocket what made you want to make this film it s very visual which appealed to me i sort of see thing in picture i don t know whether that make me dumb or smart like a kid almost and the dialogue by which i mean the character just the way they expressed themselves wa interesting it wa a simple to the point way of saying thing without saying everything the book is very interior it take place in mickey s head which wa difficult to do in a film you have to show that you can t tell it that wa a challenge mickey s state of mind and his anxiety in hanging on to this woman that he feel lucky to be with he feel that if i lose this woman then i ll never get anybody else like that i think there s a sentence that say he realized that would be the last woman he would ever get without paying for it so even though she might not be in love with him anymore he doesn t really belong in this place he ha no affinity for this place he just ha this woman what i think you get from christina s performance is the disappointment she feel he s not picking up on the signal of what she need you see them having sex and obviously that s not going very well he can t express himself and she need something she need to find out what happened to her son she need him to step up and do the right thing and he s trying but they re missing each other did you consider acting in the film no i got asked if i wa going to and every time i said no people were like good idea laugh which i wa like what the hell do you mean by that i ask because you ve directed a handful of mad men episode that s the least sort of fun of the whole thing being in it some moment where you get relaxed enough where you know the scene have done your homework know the line and you sit down and it can be really fun because you know what you re doing on one side of the camera and know what you re doing on the other like woody allen i mean i would never even put myself in the same stratosphere but he is woody allen he know what he know and he ha the time he ha ben affleck i have to say i admire the hell out of that guy with a move like argo to direct it and then give that kind of performance i don t know how the hell he dealt with that stress another example of director starring in movie is here at sundance zach braff s new film wish i wa here i m interested in zach taking 10 year to do this i m sure there are all kind of reason he wa acting he wa being successful in all kind of way i d like to try it sometime but you d have to build in the assurance that you have the proper amount of time so you didn t feel like oh i shouldn t have done this how did you cast this film did you just ask christina hendricks at the water cooler to come be in your movie i went to phil seymour hoffman first you go through the proper channel because you don t want to burden anybody with do me a favor that s a drag i sent him the script and i anticipated that he would let me down easy and say i like it but i don t have time i had sent it with an offer for the part of shelburne he called and said i love the script but i want to play mickey and it took me about two minute to realize what a great idea that wa so i said all right in then i mentioned it to christina because i wa directing an episode of mad men and saw her through the monitor and just realized she wa the perfect person i hadn t gotten phil to officially commit yet so i said here s the script i d love you to play this part and i hope to get phil she wa thrilled i sent it to richard jenkins who is represented by my agent about 45 minute later he called and said he wa in and then john turturro read it and called up and said he wa busy doing a movie but that he wanted to do it too i wa just floored there s a scene where christina is up on a balcony and the men are below in the street looking up at her she slowly walk inside and that quiet moment really illuminated how much power her character ha in this film she condoned this guy being beaten to death because he took advantage of her what i wanted to convey wa that this is a woman who know her currency all these guy know their weight in the world whether it s slapping somebody around or using the way you look to get what you want she know this guy want to get in her pant and she want to find something out she realized in that scene in the field that the way to do that is to let him do what he want but then he doesn t give her what she want and in the end she watch him getting beaten in the street and she just walk away letting it happen if she had said stop they would have stopped you mentioned earlier that making this movie 10 year ago would have been very different what do you think you bring to the table now i think just seeing more of everything life you get to a point where you re young and you re an actor and everything is always about if i could just get this if i could only get that and then you start to realize this is my place in the food chain this is what i do well i don t do everything well i can t play everything i m not a movie star i don t want to be a movie star your aspiration become more your own and then it occurs to you to want to put your own foot forward creatively you watch other people do their thing and you think i could do this i can try at this you also realize that there are sophisticated degree of performing there s actor a b c and then there s phil hoffman and richard jenkins and christina hendricks and john turturro and the fact that they said yes that s also a testament to you but when it really come down to it it s because you recognize what they do you really recognize what they re capable of doing and i should be so lucky to be able to

for mother jones but while such investigation were commonplace in the muckraker era they ve grown increasingly rare why first there s a real concern over ethic when is it okay for reporter to not announce themselves a such there s no governing body of journalism but a checklist written by poynter ethicist bob steele provides guideline for assessing when this kind of reporting is acceptable i ll paraphrase when the information obtained is of vital public interest when other effort to gain that information have been exhausted when the journalist is willing to disclose the reason and nature of any deception when the news organization applies the skill time and funding needed to fully pursue the story when the harm prevented outweighs any harm caused after meaningful deliberation of the ethical and legal issue to see what private prison are really like shane bauer applied for a job with the correction corporation of america he used his own name and social security number and he noted his employment with the foundation for national progress the publisher of mother jones he did not lie he spent four month a a guard at a cca run louisiana prison and then we spent 14 more month reporting and fact checking we took these extraordinary step because press access to prison and jail ha been vastly curtailed in recent decade even a inmate have seen their ability to sue prison often

time in ten of thousand of year the cave sits in france s scenic aveyron valley but it entrance had long been sealed by an ancient rockslide kowalsczewski s father had detected faint wisp of air emerging from the scree and the boy spent three year clearing away the rubble he eventually dug out a tight thirty meter long passage that the thinnest member of the local caving club could squeeze through they found themselves in a large roomy corridor there were animal bone and sign of bear activity but nothing recent the floor wa pockmarked with pool of water the wall were punctuated by stalactite the one that hang down and stalagmite the one that stick up some 336 meter into the cave the caver stumbled across something extraordinary a vast chamber where several stalagmite had been deliberately broken most of the 400 piece had been arranged into two ring a large one between 4 and 7 metre across and a smaller one just 2 metre wide others had been propped up against these donut yet others had been stacked into four pile trace of fire were everywhere and there wa a mass of burnt bone these weren t natural formation and they weren t the work of bear they were built by people recognizing the site s value the caver brought in archaeologist francois rouzaud using carbon dating rouzaud estimated that a burnt bear bone found within the chamber wa 47 600 year old which meant that the stalagmite ring were older than any known cave painting it also meant that they couldn t have been the work of homo sapiens their builder must have been the only early human in the south of france at the time neanderthal the discovery suggested that neanderthal were more sophisticated than anyone had given them credit for they wielded fire ventured deep underground and shaped the subterranean rock into complex construction perhaps they even carried out ritual after all there wa no evidence that anyone actually lived in the cave so what else were the ring and mound for rouzaud would never know in april 1999 while guiding colleague through a different cave he suffered a fatal heart attack with his death work on the bruniquel cave ceased and it incredible content were neglected they ve only now re entered the limelight because sophie verheyden went on holiday when i announced the age to jacques he asked me to repeat it because it wa so incredible a life long caver verheyden work at the royal belgian institute of natural science where she specializes in stalagmite she treat them a time capsule using the chemical within them to reconstruct the climate of past millennium so when she learned about bruniquel cave while visiting the region on holiday and seeing a display at a nearby castle she had only one thought why hadn t anyone dated the broken stalagmite themselves she knew that rouzaud s date of 47 600 year wa impressive but suspect carbon dating is only accurate for sample younger than 50 000 year so the bruniquel material wa hitting the technique s limit they could well have been much older to get a better estimate verheyden assembled a team including archaeologist jacques jaubert and fellow stalagmite expert dominique genty in 2013 they got permission to study the site and crawled into it themselves i m not very big and i had to put one arm before me and one behind to get through say verheyden it s kind of magical even without the structure after drilling into the stalagmite and pulling out cylinder of rock the team could see an obvious transition between two layer on one side were old mineral that were part of the original stalagmite on the other were newer layer that had been laid down after the fragment were broken off by the cave s former user by measuring uranium level on either side of the divide the team could accurately tell when each stalagmite had been snapped off for construction their date 176 500 year ago give or take a few millennium when i announced the age to jacques he asked me to repeat it because it wa so incredible say verheyden outside bruniquel cave the earliest unambiguous human construction are just 20 000 year old most of these are ruin collapsed collection of mammoth bone and deer antler by comparison the bruniquel stalagmite ring are well preserved and far more ancient and if rouzaud s work made it unlikely that modern human built the ring verheyden s study grind that possibility into the dust neanderthal must have been responsible there simply wasn t any other hominin in that region at that time when you see such a structure so far into the cave you think of something cultural or religious why did they build the ring and mound the structure weren t foundation for hut the chamber contains no stone tool human bone or any other sign of permanent occupation and besides why build shelter inside a cave a plausible explanation is that this wa a meeting place for some type of ritual social behavior say paola villa from the university of colorado museum when you see such a structure so far into the cave you think of something cultural or religious but that s not proven add verheyden indeed despite some fanciful speculation about cave bear cult no one really know nor is it clear how the neanderthal made the structure verheyden say it couldn t have been one lone artisan toiling away in the dark most likely there wa a team and a technically skilled one at that they broke rock deliberately and arranged them precisely they used fire too more than 120 fragment have red and black streak that aren t found elsewhere in the chamber or the cave beyond

because the lesson ha not been learned another simple truth ha come forward the cavalier cannot win these nba final frankly they d be lucky to win a game the warrior have now won seven consecutive game against the cavs three straight to claim last season s title twice in the 2015 16 regular season and now twice in these nba final and in each effort the cavs have found themselves further and further from victory nothing about these warrior win ha been flukey this is what they do they are prolific and ruthless a juggernaut of the highest order if anything the warrior have given the cavs opportunity in the first two game of the series in game 1 the splash brother combined to shoot 30 percent from the floor and the warrior only made nine 3 pointer total in game 2 golden state turned the ball over 20 time those were window the crack might have been small but there wa a gap there and the cavs couldn t take advantage of it the simple truth loomed too large the warrior made 15 3 pointer while the cavs made 5 on sunday a difference of 30 point in a 33 point warrior win the seventh largest margin of victory in nba final history the cavs came into sunday s game saying they were going to shoot more 3 pointer that they were going to go back to playing the style that pushed them through the eastern conference playoff with ease it wa going to be hard coach tyronn lue wa clearly fond of telling reporter over the two day gap between game 1 and 2 that it s nearly impossible to create ball movement against the warrior defense which switch assignment at all five position but the cavs had to try it wa the only path to victory instead the cavs shot two more 3 pointer in game 2 compared to game 1 they made two fewer overall cleveland is 12 of 44 from beyond the arc in this series while j r smith the team s most prolific 3 point shooter ha made only two shot from distance in the final and is shooting a 3 pointer once every 10 minute he s on the court the warrior are smothering him and he s not a dynamic enough player to create his own shot at least not an effective one how do the cavs win a game in this series it certainly appears that it s going to take some impressive change and adjustment to do so the kind of change that look beyond lue who inexplicably blamed not getting to 50 50 ball and not making the tougher play a the reason behind his team s blowout loss sunday not being beaten in every single aspect of the game a lebron james said in his postgame press conference 50 50 ball the cavalier are in the deepest 2 0 hole in nba final history the warrior 48 point differential is the largest ever through two game and it ha almost nothing to do with 50 50 ball it ha to do with the warrior elite defense it ha to do with the warrior bench being worthy of a playoff spot in the eastern conference it ha to do with kyrie irving and kevin love being underachieving one way player in a series that demand two way play against a team that ha proven beyond a shadow of a doubt that they ll exploit weak defender with cruel efficiency it ha to do with the cavs needing j r smith to be a consistent offensive producer on a nightly basis if they plan on winning it ha to do with the cavs daring draymond green to beat them and then him doing just that it ha to do with cleveland changing it offensive system and defensive ideology on the fly

seen the future of fast food and it s full of secretive cooking utensil popping out of wall and a whole lot of quinoa eatsa an innovative vegetarian automated restaurant chain which just opened it first east coast location in new york on wednesday is looking to revolutionize the food industry by offering customer a one of a kind food experience the tech savvy restaurant aim to offer fresh affordable food fast but with an unconventional twist it replaces the presence of good old fashioned cashier and waiter with robot instead of the usual face to face ordering and pickup customer at eatsa simply order their food by mean of in store kiosk online or through an app on their phone the food then mysteriously appears on location in a glass cubby displaying the customer s name and they re free to chow down this mean no line no counter and no human conversation because what could be worse the concept while intriguing also sound a bit terrifying so with a mind full of skepticism mashable headed down to the newly opened midtown manhattan location to see what all the hype is about while one might assume a cashier free environment would be completely devoid of human interaction that wa far from the case though i initially feared the establishment would have a lifeless art gallery esque vibe the music wa pumping the customer were chatting and upon walking into the sleek restaurant i wa instantly greeted by a friendly eatsa mascot much like apple genius eatsa ha several employee stationed on the floor to offer customer assistance and ensure you re not entirely left alone there are always people on the floor our mascot we call them and we re out here helping the guest and getting them through the process explained scott bruggman an eatsa corporate trainer who began a an r d chef creating bowl to the right of the wood floored room stood a row of electronic ordering kiosk and to the left the restaurant had several table for those who wanted to engage in a slightly more familiar dining experience this all felt relatively tame but the back of the restaurant held the real magic a wall made entirely of electronic microwave looking cubby that would reveal your mysteriously prepared meal zap since there wa no one to take my order i made my way to the kiosk to choose from the customizable bowl bite and beverage on eatsa s strictly vegetarian menu once i put in my request for a hummus falafel bowl i walked toward the illuminated cubby and within minute my name wa displayed on the screen above them alerting me that my order wa up this wa the moment of truth right before your food arrives in your cubby eatsa fill you with intrigue your cubby turn completely dark to prevent you from seeing the secret of the kitchen and tantalizingly display the word it s coming after you re given a playful peek at your meal the cubby give you the literal green light and you can receive your meal by tapping the glass twice tbh it felt like something straight out of the jetsons the process wa quick simple and the food wa fresh a promised though i wa satisfied with the space age experience i couldn t stop wondering what the hell wa going on behind that wall of mystery i turned to dean marsh director of market operation for the east coast for some answer but wa kindly shut down marsh adamantly explained that much like the secrecy of costumed character at disney world the public is not supposed to know what truly go on in the depth of the eatsa kitchen very ominous despite the attempt to keep the trick of the trade to themselves many believe that several human chef work alongside robot the eatsa bot are back there bruggman said there s a lot of different thing going on and we use a much technology a we can to better enhance the experience first time customer and vegetarian madee bryke and her boyfriend andrew powell also had their theory there are people back there i know that bryke said i think it s fun that there s robot but there are definitely people still working a of right now bruggman described the tech and human ratio a a real blend that s how we make it so fast and so quick with the rise of technology creating strong barrier against personal interaction one of the major concern the innovative restaurant raise is that the lack of human interaction may come across a too impersonal while this may seen like a dream for introvert surprisingly the futuristic vibe only made thing more fun millennials such a sabina m who work a few block away and wa eating there for the second day in a row felt that if anything the environment wa encouraging people to be more social maybe it s just because of the novelty she said but it seems like people are almost more social here cause everyone s like woah this is crazy so it s kind of getting people to talk to one another bryke and powell also millennials agreed i definitely think it almost open it up to more talk it seems like they have a community bryke said her boyfriend powell said that when you think about it the automated restaurant is not much different from other form of take out people already order seamless and then go pick it up from a delivery guy so how is this much different it s almost like a robot s making it anyways to get a sense of how the older demographic wa feeling about the revolutionary service gen x er and first time customer maarten nederlof gave mashable his two cent we re a little older and have been watching the whole decline in social interaction he said so this is a walk on the non interacting side for u but i think for younger people who have no social interaction coming here is a great avoidance scheme nederlof explained that there are still table so people getting food can sit down inside and socialize therefore it s the best of both world are you really missing out on that much he questioned marsh director of market operation for easta feel the restaurant s technology is actually giving people more time to engage in social interaction where you may spend 15 to 20 minute at any of our competitor getting in and out with the regular fast food concept for u it s three to four minute we feel that extra time give you even more time interact with people he said though the manhattan eatsa ha only been open for a few day the restaurant s unique style is receiving a lot of love just like like the five other location in california and d c every restaurant competitor on the street ha been in at least two time and we ve only been open for two day we ve gotten a lot of interest from the big boy

cindy sui explores this tragedy perhaps veterinarian and animal lover chien chih cheng wa in the wrong job at the wrong time she often worked overtime rarely took a proper lunch break and sacrificed her holiday to give the dog more attention and make their life better winnie lai her colleague at a shelter for abandoned dog in taoyuan city remembers a a graduate of taiwan s top university with the highest score in a civil service examination m chien could have chosen a desk job at head office but opted to personally care for the many pet abandoned each year in taiwan the shelter s lobby wa decorated with picture of animal drawn by m chien to encourage adoption but many of them were destined to be put down on 5 may last year m chien took her own life using the same drug she used to put down animal she said she wanted to help people understand what happens to stray in taiwan taiwan wa gripped by anger and soul searching in the week that followed most of it focused on a life tragically cut short but people also asked why frontline worker in taiwan s battle against pet abandonment were being put under so much pressure you might also be interested in in an interview m chien once did with a local tv station cti she described the first time she saw an animal put down i went home and cried all night she said but it wa medium appearance like this that meant she came under personal attack when it wa revealed she had put down 700 dog in two year she wa labelled the beautiful slaughterer shelter worker dreaded putting down the dog but m chien and others saw this a a better end for the unwanted ageing or difficult to adopt animal than leaving them at risk of disease in overcrowded shelter they called her a butcher we are frequently scolded some people say we ll go to hell they say we love to kill and are cruel said kao yu jie one of her co worker but people still abandon their dog you hear all kind of reason their dog is too mean or not mean enough bark too much or doesn t bark enough high kill rate taiwan ha two main problem when it come to animal welfare the number of pet being abandoned and the number of stray allowed to reproduce in reality the situation ha improved over the past decade thanks to increased public awareness and effort by shelter and activist to discourage abandonment and encourage adoption but the number of animal put down remains high and shelter are still underfunded and understaffed the work is difficult and hour long in some shelter half the animal are killed in 2015 around 10 900 were put down and about 8 600 shelter animal died last year from other cause such a illness in the cti interview m chien described the process of putting a dog down we first let it take a stroll and eat some snack and talk to it then we take it into the humane room when you put it on the table it s very scared and it whole body is shaking but after we administer the drug it leaf in three to five second it no longer shake actually it s very sad no psychological counselling wa provided for the staff psychological support in this and other field is practically unheard of in taiwan the taoyuan shelter actually had one of the lowest euthanasia rate and highest adoption rate of any shelter but a letter m chien left behind when she killed herself suggested her concern for the welfare of the animal had consumed her her colleague attest to this although expert remind u that many and complex factor lie behind any suicide she put herself under a lot of pressure she cared a lot about the animal and the pressure from the work affected her said m lai in the letter m chien wrote i hope my departure will let all of you know stray animal are also life i hope the government know the importance of controlling the source of the problem please value life the irony of her exhortation to value life wa not lost on observer and blame wa quick to be handed out newspaper accused the government of murdering her with many saying it failed to come up with effective way to stamp out pet abandonment or prevent stray from reproducing some accused higher level bureaucrat of trying to convince the public that m chien simply couldn t handle her work pressure but other commentator said that while shelter worker were easy to target all of society must take responsibility many believe the root of the problem is the insufficient enforcement of a neutering and spaying law the chief of the animal protection section of the council of agriculture chiang wen chuan said a law requiring spaying and neutering only recently came into effect and doesn t allow staff to impose fine immediately and even though staff pay visit to the owner of 60 000 animal each year to urge them to follow the law only 30 of the island s 1 7 million dog have been spayed or neutered we are very short staffed all of taiwan only ha 140 animal protection staff said mr chiang it s a systematic problem ending euthanasia and expanding shelter and staff will not solve the problem some taiwanese also believe such medical procedure change the personality of their pet others want to breed to give to friend or sell short term measure m chien already knew when she died that a new law wa coming into force from 4 february 2017 it will be illegal to put down abandoned animal budget have also increased by 40 there will be more inspector and now anybody who wish to abandon their pet at a shelter will have to pay a fee a high a 125 100 the authority say this is nothing to do with m chien s suicide and her story which wa simply a human tragedy the government ha pledged to increase funding and staffing at shelter and provide psychological counselling but many see these a short term measure activist want the government to crack down on breeder implement subsidy for ngo to spay and neuter and provide assistance to group that take in stray perhaps m chien wa not the catalyst for the change but her love for animal will not be forgotten by her husband

for the last question the interviewer asked a right triangle ha a hypotenuse equal to 10 and an altitude to the hypotenuse equal to 6 find the area of the triangle partly wondering why a software employer would be interested in a high school geometry question and partly wondering if this wa a trick the interviewee finally managed to piece together an answer he thought wa correct saying sir a area of any triangle is 0 5 base height the answer to this question would be 0 5 10 6 which evaluates to 30 but his confident response wa shut down by the interviewer he wa offered another chance to think about the question but he stuck to his gun and wa quickly told his answer wa incorrect so why would they ask such a question well rather deviously a triangle with those measurement can t exist a prashant explains in his post if the altitude is at a 45 degree angle and the hypotenuse is 10 then the largest the altitude can be is 5 a any higher altitude can t exist in a right angled triangle and nope he didn t even get the job in the end", "question": "microsoft applicant share crazy hard interview question that left him stumped what is the name of the company that asked the question",

is important to find time to reflect when you find yourself in a good place too when you re experiencing fulfillment and joy in your work or in your personal life take a moment to ask yourself what am

parentage doe stem from palpatine her battle against kylo ren continues the skywalker palpatine tension flipping the dark and light side for now that s because rey is already struggling with the pull of the dark side while every fledgling jedi struggle between the pull of light and dark there are moment during the force awakens that point to rey being tempted to the dark in the film s script it

hanging with kylo ren her staff aligned with his lightsaber to almost seem a if they re one finally what about the accent a lot of people used rey s british accent a evidence that she could be a

daylight and nighttime are about equal what is the oldest tree in the world the laser scanner used infrared light to illuminate different part of the tree each for fraction of a second this provided enough detail to map each tree within minute the researcher said the silver birch branch and leaf sagged at night they reached their lowest position a few hour before sunrise and then perked up again

in a statement the change are not too large only up to 10 centimeter 4 inch for tree with a height of about 5 meter 16 foot it s unclear if the sun woke up the tree or if they relied on their own

right the researcher wrote in the study which wa published online on feb 29 2016 in the journal frontier in plant science the finding isn t too surprising but oddly enough it hadn t been studied until now the researcher said most living organism have day and night circadian rhythm and any gardener will notice that some plant open their flower in the morning and that some tree close their leaf at night the researcher said the famed botanist carl linnaeus 1707 1778 found that flower confined to a dark cellar still opened and closed and naturalist charles darwin 1809 1882 noted that the nocturnal movement of leaf and stalk on plant looked like sleep however their study concentrated on small plant grown in pot the finding in tree represents the first study to use laser to precisely measure the nighttime movement of wild tree the researcher said the tree study didn t address why the branch and leaf drooped at night but it s likely related to the turgidity or the internal water pressure within the tree the researcher said plant movement is always closely connected with the water balance of individual cell which is affected by the availability of light through photosynthesis said study co author andra s zlinszky a researcher at the centre for ecological research at the hungarian academy of science how tall can tree grow the researcher said in the future they plan to

what many considered an overzealous pursuit of allegation of sexual transgression by mr clinton now he is being punished for leading an administration that according to a report from an ostensibly independent investigator looked the other way when baylor football player were accused of sex crime and sometimes convicted of them the relationship between athlete and sexual assault is a decade old discussion since at least the 1980s high profile rape case involving famous athlete have led the press to speculate on whether player might be more prone to committing act of sexual violence a string of sexual assault allegation in recent year ha ensured that college athletic program and the athlete that populate them will remain in the spotlight in the last two year alone player from the university of tennessee knoxville florida state university and the university of oregon have made headline for assault allegation more than 160 higher education institution are under investigation by the department of education s office of civil right for sexual violence allegation but are athlete actually more likely to commit sexual assault or are we just more likely to pay attention when they re the one accused of committing the crime one factor to consider is that sexual violence doe not occur in a vacuum anthropological research suggests that rather than a purely psychological or biological driven act sexual assault are also highly influenced by culture peggy sanday an emeritus professor of anthropology at the university of pennsylvania found that some society are more prone to rape than others tribal society with higher level of male dominance sex segregation and tolerance of interpersonal violence had higher rate of rape in other word some environment can encourage sexual aggression the recent investigation into baylor concluded that university official created a cultural perception that football wa above the rule college athletics are highly sex segregated extremely male dominated and at least in the case of some sport football and hockey for example violent by design while no university could be accused of explicitly encouraging sexual assault several have been blamed for condoning such behavior or sweeping assault allegation under the rug the recent investigation into baylor for example concluded that university official created a cultural perception that football wa above the rule and the perceived lack of consequence for star athlete might embolden them to behave in sexually aggressive way consider survey that have found that between one in six and one in three men would be willing to use force to obtain sex from woman a long a there were no consequence for their action while member of sport team and other male dominated group like fraternity and the military are indeed more likely to commit gang rape than the average person there are few conclusive study to show that athlete are more likely to commit sex crime there is some evidence that not all athlete are equally likely to be violent according to laura finley a sociologist at barry university finley told wisconsin public radio that player of power and performance sport football hockey wrestling and basketball commit violent crime more often that their peer in sport like swimming or tennis an analysis of national football league player by benjamin morris at fivethirtyeight showed that though the football star displayed lower level of domestic and sexual violence than the national average the rate of domestic violence wa still much higher than expected given their income bracket without better data it s hard to say anything definitive on the matter even the oft cited statistic that one in three sexual assault on college campus are carried out by athlete date back not to a scientific study but to a 1986 philadelphia daily news article one 1995 study did however find that male athlete were overrepresented in report of sexual assault on campus literature review which are usually useful for identifying pattern in the sea of conflicting single study that science produce are also unreliable here one recent review found that the bulk of research on the subject wa inconclusive another however found higher rate of violence among student athlete we can at least say with certainty that university have not been effective in handling the case of sexual misconduct by athlete a 2014 survey found that in more than one fifth of university the athletic department oversaw case involving sexual assault allegation against athlete prompting the national collegiate athletic association to issue a resolution that athletic department can only participate in but never lead investigation into such allegation still the recent investigation at

we re all about helping you achieve your goal so we decided to do some research about how you can actually do this first let s talk about all those cream pill treatment and surgery that promise to

at weill cornell medical college and author of the new naked tell buzzfeed life even those penile extenders and stretcher that claim to work over time would actually just be stretching your flaccid length and that ha absolutely no correlation to how big you get when hard say fisch so don t waste your money on a product or service that swears it can give you five more inch there s no actual scientific study that they rely on here s the thing say fisch you can increase the size of your penis visually the way you can do it is by losing weight this is not a trap when you have excess fat around your pubic area and stomach it could make your penis seem smaller if you lose weight you can actually gain an inch or two because the pubic fat would be le say fisch so if you ve noticed a little extra weight around that area losing a few might come with the added bonus of looking bigger where you actually want to if you re not sure where to start check out our clean eating challenge and our 28 day get fit challenge for some inspiration another way to look bigger trim your pubic hair again not a trick just an aesthetic truth cutting back the hedge will make your penis look longer obviously pubic hair grooming is a personal preference but if you re goal is to be bigger this seems way le painful than some shady penile extender you can buy off the internet then make sure your boner is at maximum capacity because it might not be whatever your maximal length or girth is you can t get it bigger than that say fisch however a lot of men don t meet their potential that s usually because they re not getting enough blood flow to the penis which could be the result of being overweight smoking increased cholesterol high blood pressure diabetes or cardiovascular disease so the first step in your penis growing experiment should be to get the rest of your body healthy especially your cardiovascular system what s good for the heart is good for the penis say fisch and ok yes there are some pill you can take obviously erectile dysfunction med like viagra and cialis are the most common while they won t necessarily add inch they do increase blood flow to the penis so if you re not getting a firm erection on your own these can help you hit your peak penis length talk to your doctor if you think you could benefit from a prescription supplement can also help like antioxidant to increase your vascular health or l arginine to increase nitric oxide and blood flow both of which can lead to stronger boner say fisch it s worth noting here that if you re having problem getting or maintaining an erection or if your erection just aren t what they used to be that could be a sign of a bigger health issue like heart disease definitely talk to your doctor if you re experiencing problem like this don t just borrow a few pill from your friend s viagra rx all that being said you really shouldn t worry so much about your size anyway seriously first of all if you re feeling ill equipped after watching porn stop comparing your good to a porn star s the average erect penis is 5 4 inch and most men fall within an inch of that say fisch chance are you re actually pretty close to average and if you re worrying about your size pleasing your partner remember that penetration is just one part of sex and everyone s preference are different many woman don t even orgasm from penile vaginal sex for instance and other people don t care very much about size or length the size of your penis could possibly be unrelated entirely to your partner s ability to experience pleasure now let s have an honest conversation about those who do have a smaller than average penis sure you may encounter partner who may be turned off by that a with any physical or sexual preference but you ll also find partner who are turned on by it or who don t care either way it s all about finding the right sexual compatibility with the right partner and that might include adding more oral stimulation manual stimulation sex toy and so on it s 100 entirely possible to have an amazing sex life with any size penis or you know none at all bottom line you can t magically grow a bigger penis and that s ok yes you can make some small health and aesthetic tweak to have the biggest and hardest penis that s physically possible for you but in the end the best thing you can

"context": "some of my christian friend tell me they can t in good conscience vote for donald trump because when faced with a choice between the lesser of two evil the morally right thing is to choose neither one they recommend voting for a third party or write in candidate a a professor who ha taught christian ethic for 39 year i think their analysis is incorrect now that trump ha won the gop nomination i think voting for trump is a morally good choice american citizen need patience with each other in this difficult political season close friend are inevitably going to make different decision about the election we still need to respect each other and thank god that we live in a democracy with freedom to differ about politics and we need to keep talking with each other because democracy function best when thoughtful citizen can calmly and patiently dialog about the reason for their difference this is my contribution to that discussion a good candidate with flaw i do not think that voting for donald trump is a morally evil choice because there is nothing morally wrong with voting for a flawed candidate if you think he will do more good for the nation than his opponent in fact it is the morally right thing to do i did not support trump in the primary season i even spoke against him at a pastor conference in february but now i plan to vote for him i do not think it is right to call him an evil candidate i think rather he is a good candidate with flaw he is egotistical bombastic and brash he often lack nuance in his statement sometimes he blurts out mistaken idea such a bombing the family of terrorist that he later must abandon he insult people he can be vindictive when people attack him he ha been slow to disown and rebuke the wrongful word and action of some angry fringe supporter he ha been married three time and claim to have been unfaithful in his marriage these are certainly flaw but i don t think they are disqualifying flaw in this election on the other hand i think some of the accusation hurled against him are unjustified his many year of business conduct show that he is not racist or anti legal immigrant or anti semitic or misogynistic i think these are unjust magnification by a hostile press exaggerating some careless statement he ha made i think he is deeply patriotic and sincerely want the best for the country he ha been an unusually successful problem solver in business he ha raised remarkable child many who have known him personally speak highly of his kindness thoughtfulness and generosity but the main reason i call him a good candidate with flaw is that i think most of the policy he support are those that will do the most good for the nation seek the good of the nation should christian even try to influence election at all yes definitely the apostle peter say christian are exile on this earth 1 peter 1 1 therefore i take seriously the prophet jeremiah s exhortation to the jewish people living in exile in babylon seek the welfare of the city where i have sent you into exile and pray to the lord on it behalf for in it welfare you will find your welfare jeremiah 29 7 by way of modern application i think christian today have a similar obligation to vote in such a way that will seek the welfare of the united state therefore the one overriding question to ask is this which vote is most likely to bring the best result for the nation if this election is close which seems likely then if someone vote for a write in candidate instead of voting for trump this action will directly help hillary clinton because she will need one le vote to win therefore the question that christian should ask is this can i in good conscience act in a way that help a liberal like hillary clinton win the presidency under president obama a liberal federal government ha seized more and more control over our life but this can change this year we have an unusual opportunity to defeat hillary clinton and the pro abortion pro gender confusion anti religious liberty tax and spend big government liberalism that she champion i believe that defeating that kind of liberalism would be a morally right action therefore i feel the force of the word of james whoever know the right thing to do and fails to do it for him it is sin james 4 17 some may feel it is easier just to stay away from this messy trump clinton election and perhaps not even vote but the teaching of scripture do not allow u to escape moral responsibility by saying that we decided to do nothing the prophet obadiah rebuked the people of the edom for standing by and doing nothing to help when the babylonian conquered jerusalem on the day that you stood aloof on the day that foreigner entered his gate and cast lot for jerusalem you were like one of them obadiah 1 11 i am writing this article because i doubt that many i can t vote for trump christian have understood what an entirely different nation would result from hillary clinton a president or have analyzed in detail how different a trump presidency would be in what follows i will compare the result we could expect from a clinton presidency with what we could expect from a trump presidency the supreme court with clinton a president hillary clinton would quickly replace justice scalia with another liberal like breyer ginsburg sotomayor and kagan this would give liberal a 5 4 majority on the supreme court even without justice kennedy and 6 3 when he vote with them but that is not all justice ginsburg is 83 and she ha had colon cancer pancreatic cancer and ha a heart stent justice kennedy is 80 justice breyer is 78 a president clinton could possibly nominate three or four justice to the supreme court locking in a far left activist judiciary for perhaps 30 or more year she could also add dozen of activist judge to federal district court and court of appeal the court where 99 of federal lawsuit are decided judicial tyranny of the type we have seen when abortion right and same sex marriage were forced on the nation would gain a permanent triumph the nation would no longer be ruled by the people and their elected representative but by unelected unaccountable activist judge who would dictate from the bench about whatever they were pleased to decree and there would be nothing in our system of government that anyone could do to stop them that is why this election is not just about hillary clinton it is about defeating the far left liberal agenda that any democratic nominee would champion liberal democrat are now within one supreme court justice of their highest goal gaining permanent control of the nation with a five vote majority on the supreme court and then relentlessly imposing every liberal policy on the nation not through winning election but through a relentless parade of one supreme court decision after another even if clinton were to drop out of the race perhaps due to additional shocking email disclosure for example our choice in the election would be just the same because any other democratic nominee would appoint the same kind of liberal justice to the court abortion on abortion a liberal court would probably find the ban on partial birth abortion to be unconstitutional it wa upheld by only a 5 4 majority in gonzalez v carhart 2007 in addition the court could find an absolute right to abortion in the equal protection clause of the constitution and then sweep away with one decision most or all of the restriction on abortion that pro life advocate worked for tirelessly over the last 43 year including ultrasound requirement waiting period parental consent requirement and prohibition on non doctor performing abortion voter should not doubt the power of the supreme court to abolish all these law restricting abortion think of the power of the obergefell v hodges 5 4 decision in june 2015 it instantly nullified all the work that thousand of christian had done over many year in persuading the citizen of 31 state to pas constitutional amendment defining marriage a the union of one man and one woman but no one is campaigning for such law or amendment anymore because it would be futile the supreme court ha spoken and therefore the issue is settled in the political system of the united state we lost not at the ballot box but because we had a liberal supreme court that nullified the democratic process regarding the definition of marriage so it would certainly be with any effort to place legal limitation on abortion nobody would campaign any more for law to limit abortion because any such law would be unconstitutional the legislative lobbying work of pro life advocacy group would be totally and utterly defeated million of unborn child would continue to die religious liberty the current liberal agenda often includes suppressing christian opposition to it view so a liberal court would increasingly nullify right of conscience with respect to forced participation in same sex marriage ceremony or expressing moral objection to homosexual conduct already christian are being pushed out of many occupation florist baker and professional photographer have had their business destroyed by large fine for refusal to contribute their artistic talent to a specific event a same sex wedding ceremony to which they had moral objection fire chief kelvin cochran in atlanta wa removed from his job because of self publishing a religious book that briefly mentioned the bible s teaching regarding non marital sexual conduct including homosexuality amidst a host of other topic his situation hold ominous implication for any christian who hold public sector job in our military service many high ranking officer have quietly been forced to resign because they were unwilling to give support to the homosexual agenda mozilla firefox ceo brendan eich wa pushed out from his own company merely because he had donated money to proposition 8 in california supporting marriage between one man and one woman this event ha troubling implication for christian in any corporate executive role who dare to support a political position contrary to the liberal agenda last year boston urologist paul church a harvard medical school faculty member lost his hospital privilege at beth israel deaconess medical center because he had expressed concern about the medical danger associated with same sex activity are my prediction about this kind of loss of religious liberty too grim the three conservative justice still on the supreme court expressed similar concern just last month the case concerned a washington pharmacy that ha been owned for 70 year by the stormans family who are committed christian they will likely now be put out of business by the washington state pharmacy board for refusing to dispense an abortion causing prescription drug on june 28 2016 the supreme court refused to hear the stormans appeal in spite of the strong dissent written by justice alito joined by robert and thomas at issue are washington state regulation that are likely to make a pharmacist unemployable if he or she object on religious ground to dispensing certain prescription medication there is much evidence that the impetus for the adoption of the regulation wa hostility to pharmacist whose religious belief regarding abortion and contraception are out of step with prevailing opinion in the state if this is a sign of how religious liberty claim will be treated in the year ahead those who value religious freedom have cause for great concern italic added christian business owner if clinton appoints just one more liberal justice it is likely that many christian business owner will be targeted hobby lobby won it 2014 supreme court case again 5 4 so it wa not compelled to dispense abortifacient to it employee but that case could be reversed the four liberal justice in the minority ginsburg breyer sotomayor and kagan are still on the court if that case is overturned it would force hobby lobby out of business because the green family had said they would shut down the company of 23 000 employee and over 3 billion in annual sale if they lost the decision the implication for other christian business owner with pro life conviction are ominous these incident show that it is not an exaggeration to say that under a liberal supreme court resulting from hillary clinton s election christian would increasingly experience systematic exclusion from hundred of occupation with thousand of people losing their job step by step christian would increasingly be marginalized to the silent fringe of society is withholding a vote from donald trump important enough to pay this high a price in loss of freedom some christian have even hinted to me that persecution would be good for u but the bible never encourages u to seek persecution or hope for it we should rather work to prevent such oppression of christian just a jesus taught u to pray lead u not into temptation but deliver u from evil matthew 6 13 paul did not encourage u to pray that god would give u bad ruler but good one who would allow u to live a peaceful life i urge that supplication prayer intercession and thanksgiving be made for all people 2 for king and all who are in high position that we may lead a peaceful and quiet life godly and dignified in every way 1timothy 2 1 christian school and college a liberal supreme court would also impact education christian college would likely be found guilty of discrimination if they required adherence to the bible s standard regarding sexual conduct or even required affirmation of primary christian belief campus ministry like cru and intervarsity have already been forced off of many university campus following the 5 4 supreme court decision cl v martinez 2010 which upheld the exclusion of the christian legal society from the campus of hastings college of law in san francisco and now california s equity in higher education act sb 1146 which recently passed the california state senate and will likely become law would prohibit christian college from requiring student or employee to hold christian belief or abide by biblical moral standard regarding sexual conduct and would prohibit college from assigning housing based on a student s biological sex if a student claimed to be transgender college like biola and azusa pacific could not long survive under those regulation with regard to elementary and high school law promoting school choice or tuition voucher program would likely be declared unconstitutional if they allowed such funding to go to christian school a tax credit program for scholarship to private school including christian institution wa only upheld by a 5 4 supreme court decision in arizona christian school tuition organization v winn in 2011 and all four liberal justice who voted against it are still on the court another possible target of the liberal agenda would be law that allow for home schooling if the secular liberal governmental hostility to home schooling in european country is any indicator church church would not be exempt from the impact of a liberal supreme court the court could rule that any school district is allowed to ban church from renting school building on sunday an action that could severely hinder the work of small church and church planting in general this wa already the ruling of the second circuit in the bronx household of faith case regarding new york city public school and some church in iowa have now been told that they have to make their bathroom open to people on the basis of their gender identity if the church are going to be open to the public at all freedom of speech freedom of speech would be increasingly restricted in the public square in 2014 the supreme court ruled that prayer of visiting pastor who prayed in jesus name when they opened a city council meeting were allowed under the constitution but again it wa a 5 4 decision town of greece v galloway and all four liberal who wanted to restrict such prayer are still on the court criminalizing dissent another troubling possibility is that liberal activist once in power would further entrench themselves by criminalizing much political dissent we have already seen it happen with the irs targeting of conservative group and with some state attorney general taking step to prosecute group who dare to disagree with activist claim about the danger of man made global warming but my conscience won t let me vote for donald trump some have told me but i wonder if their conscience have considered the gravity of these destructive consequence that would come from a clinton presidency a vote for trump would at least be doing something to prevent these thing in addition i think there are several positive reason to vote for trump the supreme court with trump a president trump ha released a list of 11 judge to show the kind of nominee he would appoint to the supreme court a lawyer familiar with many of these name ha told me that they constitute a dream list of outstanding judge who would uphold the original meaning of the constitution and would not create new law from the bench trump ha said he would rely primarily on advice from the federalist society the organization that promotes the original meaning view so strongly exemplified by justice scalia before his death if trump would appoint a replacement for scalia from his list of 11 and probably one or two other supreme court justice then we could see a 5 4 or even 6 3 majority of conservative justice on the supreme court the result for the nation would be overwhelmingly good such a supreme court would finally return control of the nation to the people and their elected representative removing it from dictatorial judge who repeatedly make law from the bench abortion such a court would likely overturn roe v wade and return abortion law and the regulation of abortion to the state religious liberty a conservative court would vigorously uphold the first amendment protecting freedom of religion and freedom of speech for christian college christian ministry and church such a court would likely overturn the horribly destructive decision in lemon v kurtzman 1971 that changed the meaning of the first amendment and ruled that a government action must not have the primary effect of either advancing or inhibiting religion note not a specific denomination but religion in general a conservative court would likely declare that the first amendment wa only intended to prohibit the establishment of a state sponsored church or denomination such a decision would once again allow the nonsectarian affirmation of personal belief in god in public school would once again allow coach to pray with their football team before a game and would allow visiting clergy to be invited to give a prayer at high school graduation ceremony it would also imply that nativity scene without santa claus and buddha should be allowed in government owned park and building at christmas time it wouldn t require these thing but would allow them if local official chose to approve them it would restore true freedom of religion a the first amendment intended it would also protect freedom of conscience for christian who object to participating in abortion or dispensing abortifacient medicine or who do not wish to participate in same sex wedding ceremony it is also possible that a conservative supreme court would eventually return control of marriage to the state freedom for christian influence in politics significantly trump ha pledged to work to repeal the 1954 johnson amendment to the irs code which ha been used for 62 year a a threat to silence pastor from speaking about political issue for fear of losing their tax exempt status this would be a great victory for freedom of religion and freedom of speech in short a trump appointed supreme court together with dozen of lower court judge appointed by him would probably result in significant advance in many of the policy area important to christian it would also open the door to huge expansion of influence for the many christian lobbying group known a family policy council in various state especially enabling them to work for further legal protection for life for marriage and family and for religious liberty how can we know that trump won t change his mind but trump ha changed his mind in the past a politically minded friend said to me how do you know that he will do what he ha promised maybe he ll betray you and appoint a liberal supreme court justice my reply is that we can never know the future conduct of any human being with 100 certainty but in making an ethical decision like this one we should base the decision on the most likely result in this case the most likely result is that trump will do most or all of what he ha said in the history of american politics candidate who have been elected president have occasionally changed their mind on one or another issue while in office but no president ha ever gone back on most of what he ha promised to do especially on issue that are crucially important in the election in this election it is reasonable to think that the most likely result is that both trump and clinton will do what they have promised to do that is the basis on which we should decide how to vote and notice how trump ha changed his mind he continues to move in a more conservative direction a evidenced by his list of judge and his choice for vice president just a he succeeded in business by listening to the best expert to solve each problem i suspect that he ha been learning from the best expert in conservative political thought and ha increasingly found that conservative solution really work we should applaud these change his choice of indiana gov mike penny a his vice presidential running mate is an especially significant indication that he will govern a a conservative trump could have picked a moderate but instead picked a lifelong solid conservative who is a thoughtful gracious policy wizard penny is a lawyer and former talk radio host who served 12 year in congress and had significant congressional leadership position so he will be immensely helpful in working with congress he is a committed evangelical christian he is a former board member of the indiana family institute a conservative christian lobbying group in indiana however the supreme court is not the only issue at stake in this election while i disagree with trump on a few thing especially trade policy on most important issue trump will likely do much good for the nation tax and job trump ha pledged to cut tax significantly while clinton want to raise them trump is advocating a 15 tax rate for corporation rather than the current 35 lower corporate tax would lead to business expansion and a massive increase in available job and higher pay level for individual taxpayer trump favor a top rate of 25 but for clinton it s 45 most small business file under this individual rate so once again trump s lower tax would result in substantial expansion of business and many more job finally our economy would snap out of it eight year of anemic growth in my judgment christian should support lower tax rate that would lead to more job because obama s economic policy for the last eight year have hurt lower income and low middle income family the most many can t even find job and others can t find full time job those who have job struggle to survive with no meaningful pay raise year after year it is no surprise that these are the people who are supporting trump in overwhelming number tax rate are also a good indicator of government control higher tax rate mean greater government control of our life while lower tax rate indicate greater freedom minority two of the deepest cause of poverty among minority group and racial tension in our country are failing public school in our inner city and lack of available job trump expressed a commitment to solve these problem at several point in his acceptance speech at the republican convention he pledged to reduce tax and regulation leading to many more job and he said nearly 4 in 10 african american child are living in poverty while 58 of african american youth are not employed this administration ha failed america s inner city it s failed them on education it s failed and on job it s failed them on crime every action i take i will ask myself doe this make life better for young american in baltimore chicago detroit ferguson who have a much of a right to live out their dream a any other child in america we will rescue kid from failing school by helping their parent send them to a safe school of their choice by contrast clinton will bow to the teacher union and oppose school choice at every turn and she will continue to strangle business with high tax and regulation

russia and iran push u around anymore a obama ha done with hillary clinton s support when she wa secretary of state if trump is anything he is tough a nail and he won t be bullied israel trump ha

approve the keystone oil pipeline and grant more oil drilling permit leading to lower energy cost and providing thousand of job lower energy cost help everybody but the poor most of all clinton by contrast will make fracking nearly impossible and essentially abolish the coal industry causing energy price to skyrocket executive order and bathroom trump ha promised to rescind many of the most objectionable executive order given by president obama so he will likely end the compulsory moral degradation forced on u by a liberal agenda including order forcing school to allow boy in girl bathroom and locker room in defiance of the will of the vast majority of american but hillary clinton would likely perpetuate and expand these policy health care trump will work to repeal obamacare which is ruining the nation s health care system and replace it with an affordable free market system in which company have the ability to sell insurance across state line thus substantially lowering insurance price especially in those state that currently allow only high priced cadillac insurance plan but clinton would continue to work relentlessly toward federal government control of our entire

cannot find good job cannot find good school for their child do not feel protected from crime and find their retirement saving are not enough because for year they have been earning no interest in the bank trump said in his acceptance speech every day i wake up determined to deliver for the people i have met all across the nation that have been neglected ignored and abandoned i have joined the political arena so that the powerful can no longer beat up on people that cannot defend themselves these american citizen recognize that trump ha built a business career on listening to expert solving problem and getting thing done they realize that trump didn t earn 4 billion by being stupid and their instinct say that he might be exactly the right person to solve some of the biggest problem in a nation that ha for too long been headed in the wrong direction and stuck in political gridlock they may not have college degree but their old fashioned common sense tell them that america would be a much better place if we no longer had to be afraid to say merry christmas or that boy are different from girl or that islamic terrorist are islamic terrorist they re sick and tired of being condescended to by the snobbish moralism of the liberal elite who dominate the power center in our nation that is why they cheer when trump repeatedly violates the canon of politically correct speech they have found in him someone who give them hope and they are supporting him by the thousand doe character matter but are you saying that character doesn t matter someone might ask i believe that character doe matter but i think trump s character is far better than what is portrayed by much current political mud slinging and far better than his opponent s character in addition if someone make doubt about character the only factor to consider that is a fallacy in ethical reasoning that i call reductionism the mistake of reducing every argument to only one factor when the situation requires that multiple factor be considered in this election an even larger factor is the future of the nation that would flow from a clinton or a trump presidency to my friend who tell me they won t vote for trump because there is a chance he won t govern at all like he promise i reply that all of american presidential history show that that result is unlikely and it is ethically fallacious reasoning to base a decision on assuming a result that is unlikely to happen consider instead the most likely result the most likely result of voting for trump is that he will govern the way he promise to do

like the one experienced after getting stoned the result even suggest that it may be a reaction of the body that cause the hunger boost much like getting the munchies after a joint conducting the study the university of chicago invited 14 men and woman in their twenty to come and participate in two session at the clinical research centre there at the university the researcher controlled the sleep pattern of the participant meaning that sometimes they slept 7 hour and at other time their sleep wa reduced down to only 4 hour and 11 minute the researcher also controlled how much food and what food wa being served to the participant serving them three meal a day at 9 am 2 pm and 7 pm after the fourth night of each session the participant were offered snack from which to choose they included the kind of snack we like to indulge in when we are stoned such a extremely sweet or salty food they found that those that were sleep deprived were far le likely to resist the offer of snack and their urge to binge on them wa highest in the afternoon right through to the early evening sleep deprivation and obesity it ha long been believed that there is a link between sleep deprivation and obesity and this study can confirm the very reason that they may be linked depriving the human body of sleep interfere s with it production of hormone that control thing like appetite and satiety the scientist conducting this study looked into the kind of hormone that were present in the blood during the study they looked specifically at the hormone ghrelin and leptin ghrelin is the hormone that deal with appetite whereas leptin is the hormone that tell the brain when the body is full of food the endocannabinoid system finally the scientist decided that they would delve a little further into the body s craving for food and have a look at the endocannabinoid system the same system that is excited and activated by using marijuana erin hanlon who lead the study found that there wa a certain endocannabinoid that wa increased after sleep deprivation that could be the cause for the increase in appetite endocannabinoid 2 ag is the chemical that increase the amount of pleasure you feel after you eat and is an endocannabinoid that also increase after the use of marijuana we know that marijuana activates the endocannabinoid system and cause people to overeat when they are not hungry and they normally eat yummy sweet and fatty food hanlon said sleep restriction may cause overeating by acting in the same manner so it seems that sleep deprivation ha a very similar effect on the body in term of appetite a using marijuana doe this mean that a future of dealing with obesity through medicine that target the endocannabinoid system is possible although much more consideration would be

it neither had i yet it strike many older american usually in their 70 and 80 more woman than men the afflicted are more often of northern european extraction indicating to researcher that genetics may be at work fortunately pmr responds quickly to the steroid drug prednisone the important thing is to recognize not ignore the symptom and seek help i felt better within a day of finally seeing my doctor being diagnosed and taking my first dose of prednisone in most case the condition can be cured although slowly over month sometimes year and in some situation it can be complicated by a more serious disease why and how pmr strike is mysterious although researcher are looking at virus or stress a trigger for the disease but undeniably it is associated with aging and particularly the aging immune system with the first wave of baby boomer heading into their 70 this year america s elderly population will swell and doctor think there will almost certainly be more case of pmr basically polymyalgia rheumatica trick the immune system into attacking it own body sending antibody and immune cell into the hundred of fluid filled sac called bursa that lie throughout our joint and surrounding soft tissue in the healthy body those sac some no wider than a dime others the size of a silver dollar keep our joint moving smoothly but when inflamed by pmr they cause pain and stiffness pmr also impedes the bone marrow s ability to make red blood cell causing anemia such an inflammatory response is like a complex cascade according to marcy o koon moss director of consumer health for the arthritis foundation which count pmr among more than 100 disease it focus on it s not one thing that happens the cell involved signal each other and communicate she said many people stricken with pmr confuse their symptom with aging and just soldier on but a the disease progress and becomes more debilitating most figure that something beyond old age is at work phil ringo 74 of haverford pa

papa unable to get out of a chair or into a cab without a struggle he got no answer from his doctor and when he tried for an appointment with one of the nation s top diagnostic clinic they basically said you re an old guy ringo said just get used to it he wa finally diagnosed and treated after a friend with the disease convinced him to see a rheumatologist actually pmr is famously tricky to diagnose a definitive test doe not exist for pmr said rheumatologist rebecca manno a john hopkins school of medicine faculty member and researcher and there are other condition that mimic pmr such a rheumatoid arthritis various infection and even some form of cancer so the diagnostic process can be torturous leslie kermath 70 of whitefish mont spent almost a month undergoing test before her doctor felt confident that pmr wa causing her pain stiffness and fever along the way she got antibiotic for an existing urinary tract infection wa sent to the hospital for a chest x ray and a cat scan after a test flagged a possible blood clot later she had another cat scan of her abdomen and pelvis because her hip were terribly painful a lyme disease test came back negative eventually her blood test which showed increasing level of inflammation plus her symptom and age nailed the diagnosis for kermath s doctor who started her on prednisone how many woman of caucasian origin who are older think they re just aging and can t do everything they used to when they actually have this disease said kermath who is an avid hiker most doctor suspecting pmr order several blood test almost always two that look for inflammation the erythrocyte sedimentation rate known a the esr test and another for crp or c reactive protein doctor also check for antibody associated with rheumatoid arthritis to rule out that disease when i finally dragged myself to my internist three month after my symptom showed up she immediately suspected pmr given my age 73 my symptom and lab result showing considerable inflammation and anemia she started me on prednisone and sent me to a rheumatologist after eight week of prednisone my inflammation number had fallen to near normal and my anemia wa under control my rheumatologist ha reduced my steroid dose but only very gradually because rebound do happen the hope is that i can be steroid free a sign of a cure sometime in 2017 treating pmr is one of the more gratifying part of my practice said my doctor joseph p laukaitis in my experience about 95 percent of patient fully recover for a pmr patient prednisone feel like a miracle drug because it so quickly attack inflammation and banishes the pain and stiffness but in fact prednisone is wonderful wicked in manno s word the side effect that some people experience are considerable a thinning of the bone already a problem for many older woman high blood pressure weight gain high blood sugar insomnia and a distinctive addition of facial fat known a moon face most patient who take prednisone for pmr will also be prescribed a drug to slow bone loss and that medication too ha side effect although diagnosing pmr can be difficult doing so is crucial because a much more serious disease giant cell arteritis strike about 10 to 20 percent of people with pmr giant cell arteritis cause inflammation and damage to blood vessel in the head and elsewhere untreated it can cause blindness stroke even death pmr patient can expect their doctor to look for symptom of gca severe headache tender scalp jaw pain and blurred vision any one of those can indicate that the artery of the head are inflamed the diagnosis often requires a biopsy of one of the artery in the scalp to confirm inflammation again prednisone is the treatment much of today s research into pmr and gca look for alternative to prednisone biologics drug made from living organism hold promise because some can inhibit an inflammatory response a it pick up steam the arthritis foundation s o koon moss said it s like interrupting a chain reaction there are also promising clinical trial of drug that treat rheumatoid arthritis and have fda approval for that and they may be effective for pmr manno said until other drug become

heyward who easily caught the ball for the first out jason kipnis followed him and flailed meekly at a low changeup for strike three francisco lindor then hit a grounder to second that appeared to be an easy out but javier baez slipped when trying to throw from his knee which allowed lindor to reach safely hendricks wa able to work around the error by inducing a broken bat grounder to shortstop from mike napoli to end the inning victor mather hendricks last pitched in game 3 when he threw 4 1 3 somewhat shaky inning giving up six hit and two walk but crucially like the first inning tonight he gave up no run david waldstein terry francona wa on a pregame humor jag making joke about how he had a dream after game 6 that someone wa breaking his rib he woke up to discover he had been sleeping on the tv remote and it wa stuck in his ribcage he also admitted he wa dipping pretzel in peanut butter in bed and when he woke up there wa peanut butter on his glass my bedroom looked like a national disaster last night he said too much info top of 2nd kluber settle in kluber got through the inning in an efficient seven pitch addison russell wa the offensive star of game 6 with a two run double and a grand slam but corey kluber wa able to retire him in his first at bat tonight on a towering popup to shortstop willson contreras then hit a pitch into right field foul territory that lonnie chisenhall tracked down with little effort jason heyward shattered his bat popping out to shortstop david waldstein kluber settle down to retire the last six batter all on fly ball kluber is 12 1 in his last 14 start at progressive field with a 1 87 earned run average including postseason game but this is the only time he ha started three time in nine day now it s up the the indian hitter to get him back even bottom of 2nd hendricks help himself the indian had runner reach base twice in the half inning but got nothing to show for it jose ramirez led off with a grounder that caromed off of kyle hendricks before rolling toward shortstop with the ball coming at him fairly slowly addison russell tried to barehand it but came up without the ball a ramirez reached first the play wa ruled a single rather than an error a russell likely did not have a play ramirez however underestimated hendricks ability to hold on runner and got picked off of first lonnie chisenhall singled but rajai davis grounded into a 5 4 3 double play that wa truly impressive considering davis s speed david waldstein great play by the icy veined kyle hendricks to pick off jose ramirez off first but everyone know hendricks ha a terrific pickoff move so it is kind of unforgivable to get caught that really messed up the inning because chisenhall s single would have put two runner on base with nobody out the indian were very sloppy in game 6 and cannot afford to do that again especially with the cub batter getting warmed up in this weather top of 3rd schwarber run cub out of inning javier baez put a big swing on a 1 1 curveball but just missed a he flied out to left for the first out of the inning dexter fowler he of the leadoff home run then jumped on the first pitch he saw from corey kluber in his second at bat but lined out to right with two out kyle schwarber swung into the shift and punched the ball through the crowded right side of the infield but schwarber got greedy and tried to stretch the hit into a double and wa thrown out easily at second base by lonnie chisenhall to end the inning victor mather maybe you aren t a baseball fan well akron and toledo are involved in some exciting college football maction on espn2 a you might expect with an indian world series on the line the crowd is sparse in akron david waldstein lonnie chisenhall ha had an adventurous world series but he ha a great arm and schwarber never should have challenged it especially with a surgically repaired knee the shenanigan in the outfield in game 6 were mostly miscommunication and the fault of the center fielder tyler naquin and that is why he is on the bench bottom of 3rd indian get aggressive the indian tied the game thanks to a leadoff double a well placed bunt and a run scoring single it looked like it could get far worse for the cub but kyle hendricks once again worked his way around a few baserunners coco crisp got thing started by showing some serious aggressiveness lacing a ball into the left field corner and legging out a leadoff double hoping to take advantage of the baserunner by playing some small ball the indian had roberto perez bunt crisp over to third carlos santana then crushed a 1 0 curveball to right for a single bringing crisp home and tying the game with one run in jason kipnis hit what looked like a double play ball to shortstop addison russell flipped to javier baez who dropped the ball and all runner were ruled safe after a review of the play the defensive miscue set cleveland up with runner on first and second with one out but francisco lindor flied out to left and mike napoli lined out to third to end the threat victor mather it s been a tough series for napoli who wa 4 for 19 without an extra base hit coming into this game is 0 for 2 tonight and just missed his chance with men on first and second and two out it wa a great advertisement for replay when the terrible out call on santana at second wa overturned baez never had it david waldstein the indian are squaring up on hendricks so cub manager joe maddon instructed jon lester to start warming up it wa so important for the indian to get back even which is why they played for the one run some may have wanted the indian to play for the big inning since they seemed to be on hendricks but francona elected to draw even roberto perez did a terrific job of executing the bunt with rizzo only about 20 foot away from him the cub particularly baez are looking shaky top of 4th cub back on top a shallow pop fly to center and some aggressive baserunning by kris bryant put the cub back in the lead willson contreras tacked on an r b i double and with a 3 1 lead chicago had some breathing room for the first time this game bryant led off the inning by working a full count against corey kluber and on the eighth pitch of the at bat he singled on a hard grounder to left anthony rizzo wa hit in the right shoulder by a pitch bringing up ben zobrist with two runner on and no out he hit a grounder to first that mike napoli fielded and threw to francisco lindor who wa covering second rizzo slid in under lindor s foot but wa ruled out even though lindor s foot may not have been on the bag that brought up addison russell with runner at the corner and he hit a shallow pop up to center bryant knowing that rajai davis doe not have a strong throwing arm broke for home a davis caught the ball and he slid in just ahead of the tag from roberto perez kluber looked like he had contreras on the rope with two out but the young catcher launched a 2 2 curveball into deep center that got over davis s head zobrist scored and contreras got into second base easily kluber ended the bleeding by retiring jason heyward on a pop out to shortstop david waldstein now the indian are making the miscue the cub scored twice but it could have been and maybe should have been zero the believelanders are feeling like bereavelanders victor mather wilson contreras 1 for 17 coming into tonight ha probably been the cub worst series performer but he come through to give the cub the 3 1 lead his rookie season wa a key part of the cub fine year now he add a big world series r b i bottom of 4th hendricks work well with a lead kyle hendricks undoubtedly ha an incredibly short leash from joe maddon but he started thing off well in the half inning by retiring jose ramirez on a soft grounder to first base he retired lonnie chisenhall on a soft fly to left for the second out and got rajai davis to fly to right to end the inning hendricks ha thrown just 50 pitch but it would be surprising if he stayed in the game beyond the fifth inning david waldstein that wa a great inning by hendricks one of the most important thing in pitching is the shutdown inning after your team score hendricks had his cleanest frame of the game and that wa vital in term of solidifying the lead and demoralizing the indian the tension and the excitement that wa felt in this stadium just an inning ago ha changed perceptibly now it feel just a tiny bit more like a sense of inevitability the cub seem to be rolling ever since game 5 still a way to go though the meat of the indian order come up at least two more time top of 5th baez end kluber s night the cub extended their lead to four the hard way by getting one apiece off of corey kluber and andrew miller javier baez took a hard cut at kluber s first pitch of the inning and crushed a home run ending the ace s night terry francona immediately headed to the mound to replace him with miller and start what could be a long night for the indian bullpen dexter fowler wa the first batter to face miller and wa not intimidated by the reliever stroking a 1 2 slider into left for a single but kyle schwarber gave miller some help by grounding into a 6 4 3 double play kris bryant came up with two out and worked a full count off of miller he somehow ended up drawing a walk on the ninth pitch of the at bat after seeing miller s unhittable slider on six consecutive pitch and then wa running on the pitch when anthony rizzo sliced a single to right bryant running hard the entire way wa able to score and rizzo reached second after the throw it looked like chicago could do even more damage when ben zobrist hit a ball to deep center field but rajai davis caught it on the warning track to end the inning miller who the indian would like to soak up at least a few inning ha already thrown 20 pitch david waldstein the cub are really swinging well now in the warm weather much like they did in the regular season when they scored 808 run the most by a national league team at sea level red sox had 878 run the rockies 845 perhaps it wa only a matter of time perhaps it wa fatigue among the indian pitcher perhaps it wa the addition of schwarber lengthening the lineup even baez who wa 4 for 26 with 4 single and 2 error in game 7 hit a home run off the previously impenetrable kluber they are even hitting andrew miller hard victor mather if this were the last time the cub won the world series the game would be over the decisive game 5 of that series in 1908 lasted 1 hour 25 minute no game in the series lasted more than 2 10 bottom of 5th lester and ross open door for indian the move to bring in jon lester a a reliever had major implication for the cub mostly because of the corresponding move to put in his personal catcher david ross because of two miscue by ross the indian scored two run cutting chicago s lead in half kyle hendricks wa allowed to come out to start the inning even though jon lester wa ready in chicago s bullpen he got a soft grounder to second from coco crisp for the first out and struck out roberto perez for out two but hendricks walked carlos santana and his day wa done with lester being summoned to face jason kipnis kipnis hit a soft grounder that wa fielded by ross but the veteran who had just entered the game threw the ball well out of anthony rizzo s reach which resulted in francisco lindor coming up with runner on second and third with two out lester threw a ball in the dirt that caromed off of ross s mask and a the catcher tried to go after it he stumbled taking so long to recover the ball that both runner scored lester wa able to strike out lindor to end the inning but the game certainly got more interesting because hendricks did not pitch five inning he is not in line for the victory should the cub hold on david waldstein lester and to a lesser degree ross coming into the game wa supposed to be the cub madison bumgarner moment but it looked more like an old fashioned cub moment terrific aggressive base running by jason kipnis to score from second base on a wild pitch he never hesitated and made a beautiful slide under the tag then got up and punched the air terrible inning by ross who made the error to allow kipnis to get all the way to second and then wa staggered by the ball when the wild pitch hit him in the mask it feel like a game again top of 6th ross make up for mistake david ross helped erase some of the damage his defense had done in the previous inning by launching a one out home run to center field that pushed chicago s lead back to 6 3 jason heyward wa the second out of the inning when he grounded out to first and javier baez struck out to end the inning andrew miller who looked unhittable earlier in the playoff ha now allowed two earned run and gotten just four out david waldstein i promise were not making all this up david ross who is playing in his last professional baseball game at age 39 who ha played on 21 different professional team at all level who is the elder statesman of the cub just hit his first world series home run it came after a wild inning behind the plate where he made one error then got punched in the mask by a bouncing wild pitch that allowed two run to score is it meant to be bottom of 6th indian come up short mike napoli continued his struggle by striking out to lead off the half inning that brought up jose ramirez and the third baseman grounded out to shortstop nearly beating addison russell s throw to first base that anthony rizzo made a great stretch on brandon guyer came in a a pinch hitter for lonnie chisenhall and he hit a two out single to left but rajai davis grounded out to strand him at first victor mather oct 14 1908 bennett park detroit orval overall outdueled wild bill donovan and the cub won the world series they are nine out away from doing it again top of 7th cub chase miller but fail to score dexter fowler improved to 3 for 4 by singling to start the inning that brought kyle schwarber to the plate in a tough lefty on lefty matchup against andrew miller and the ace reliever won the battle getting schwarber to fly out to left but with that that miller s day wa over with terry francona replacing him with the team s closer cody allen allen wa able to strand the runner he inherited from miller by striking out kris bryant a fowler wa caught stealing after the pitch for a double play while miller is not on the hook for a loss the game wa well below his standard he threw 43 pitch in two and one third inning allowing four hit and two earned run bottom of 7th lester get job done coco crisp flied out to left to start the inning and then jon lester ran the count full against roberto perez before walking the catcher on the seventh pitch of the at bat tyler naquin came in a a pinch runner for perez before carlos santana hit a come backer to lester the yip that have been a topic of conversation throughout the playoff were in play a lester barely looked at second before throwing underhand to first to get one out on a play that would have gotten two with almost any other pitcher on the mound lester did not end up paying for it a he struck out jason kipnis to end the inning top of 8th allen shuts down cub a dropped strike three forced a throw to first base but anthony rizzo wa easily retired to start the inning then ben zobrist looked completely overwhelmed by cody allen s stuff before eventually grounding out to first addison russell watched strike one and two sail right past him before popping out to first base to end the inning allen ha need just 17 pitch to record five out bottom of 8th tie game a day after he wa controversially brought into a blowout rather than being preserved for a game 7 appearance aroldis chapman proved to be human by giving up chicago s three run lead in just two batter jon lester had gotten the first two out of the inning but wa pulled from the game after jose ramirez hit a ball up the middle that addison russell couldn t quite handle brought in for a four out save chapman fired seven consecutive fastball to brandon guyer topping out at 100 3 mile per hour but it wa the last one that cost him a guyer drove the ball to left center for a double bringing in a run chapman then imploded allowing a two run home run to rajai davis that tied the game and blew the save attempt coco crisp piled on with a single but yan gomes who had entered the game in the eighth inning struck out to end the inning chapman ended up throwing 21 pitch and looked like he wa completely out of gas despite the radar gun indicating he still had his velocity top of 9th cub squeeze doesn t work with new life breathed into the cleveland indian and rain starting to fall cody allen walked the leadoff batter david ross on five pitch the cub looked to capitalize by bringing in chris coghlan a a pinch runner for ross but he wa erased on a force out when jason heyward grounded to second base heyward then got something started by stealing his third base of the series and advanced to third on a bad throw from yan gomes michael martinez wa brought in a a defensive replacement in right field to help prevent a sacrifice fly from scoring a run but shaw took care of javier baez by striking him out on an awkward two strike bunt attempt that brought up dexter fowler who had been one of the cub better hitter all game and he laced a ball up the middle that looked like it would get through before francisco lindor chased it down behind second base and threw fowler out at first the indian now have a chance to win the game and the series at home in the bottom of the ninth bottom of 9th chapman shuts down indian in 9th this game is headed to extra inning aroldis chapman wa back out to start the bottom of the ninth despite having looked completely worn out in the eighth he got carlos santana to fly out before ending up in a long battle with jason kipnis he fired kipnis a steady diet of slider rather than his signature heater and ended up in a full count before slamming the door with a 97 4 mph fastball francisco lindor flied out to right ending the inning victor mather extra inning game 7 s 1924 senator giant 1991 twin brave 1997 marlin indian and tonight top of 10th rain delay then cub pounce the cub are back in the lead thanks to ben zobrist miguel montero and a couple questional intentional walk after a brief rain delay the game resumed with kyle schwarber facing off against bryan shaw the cub designated hitter once again attacked the shift hitting a grounder through the right side of the infield for his third hit of the game albert almora came in a a pinch runner for schwarber and the move paid off when kris bryant hit a deep flyout to center and almora showed off some tremendous baserunning ability by tagging up and advancing to second with first base empty shaw intentionally walked anthony rizzo to get to zobrist the versatile veteran who won a world series with kansa city last year made him pay for it by driving in almora with a double down the third base line that energized the cub shaw then issued another intentional walk this one to addison russell and with the base loaded miguel montero laced a single into left that drove in chicago s eighth run of the game cleveland brought in trevor bauer with the base loaded and one out and the losing pitcher in game 2 and 5 took care of business striking out jason heyward and getting javier baez to fly out to center field to limit the damage the indian now have three out to get back into the game bottom of 10th indian get a run but needed two with one out left in the game the indian closed their deficit to one run but that wa a close a they would get a the cub ended a world series drought that had been going since 1908 the ending wa complicated because aroldis chapman wa out of the game after throwing 35 pitch in one and one third inning with their closer gone the cub called on carl edward jr a 25 year old right hander with 41 career regular season appearance and two career save to close thing out the 2011 48th round draft pick started thing off by striking out mike napoli swinging on a 95 mph fastball he got jose ramirez to ground out to shortstop for the second out that brought up brandon guyer and edward walked him on five pitch with rajai davis who had tied the game in the eighth inning with a two run homer due up cub pitching coach chris bosio visited the mound chicago allowed guyer to advance to second base without a throw and davis delivered again with a single that drove guyer in and closed the gap to one run joe maddon wa not taking any chance and he pulled the plug on his young pitcher pulling him for michael montgomery with michael martinez due up the left hander took care of

there who are thinking ha i am a multitasking god your mortal rule can not apply to me you can eat a cheeseburger with your knee a you put on make up with your elbow and steer the car with your chin and you ve done it before that s the problem sponsored i tried catching poke mon while parked in a drive thru even then i felt dumb when i didn t move up immediately because there wa a poliwag in

leave that ar feature on to put poke mon on a backdrop of whatever s in front of you problem is you re then focusing on catching the poke mon instead of the background of reality the little sucker move around in ar mode too it s one thing to walk around your apartment trying to catch a particularly jump happy poke mon it s much worse to do so while also trying to drive you can t easily spin around in the driver s seat if a poke mon dart sideways and it take an absurd amount of your attention to follow them around anyway so keep it in park if you re going to do anything in the game you can enjoy the comfortable seat luxurious cupholders and life sustaining air conditioning of your car s interior but don t play the game itself unless your car is safely parked and out of the way of

sounded like a solid plan nope the app wa one step ahead of that idea after my roughly 48 kilometer drive to test this idea barely netted any km towards egg hatching i wondered what wa up turn out there s a speed limit on what the game will log in term of distance traveled while i couldn t find the limit published on any official channel one unofficial source on quora claimed the app is limited to 20 kph which sound about right because you have to drive safely we don t recommend puttering around at speed slower than 20 kph on public road that s only about 12 mph for those of u not fully

presented at the 249th national meeting exposition of the american chemical society and revealed that adding a teaspoon of coconut oil to boiling water with a half cup of non fortified white rice letting it simmer for 20 to 40 minute then refrigerating it for 12 hour may reduce the number of calorie your body take in by 50 to 60 percent like i said seriously cool the researcher explained that rice contains two kind of starch one that is easily digestible and one that s resistant our body don t have the enzyme needed to digest the resistant kind which mean it can t break down that starch and transform it into the sugar that typically get absorbed into the bloodstream if you have extra sugar in your bloodstream that get turned into fat which we know is no good in other word the scientist wanted to find a way to get the rice to have more resistant starch rather than digestible one to avoid that extra sugar in the body this is where the coconut oil come in adding it to the cooking process make the starch granule resistant to the action of digestive enzyme and then letting the rice cool for 12 hour push the process along translation same amount of rice fewer calorie into the body bonus you don t have to eat the rice cold to get the desired effect reheating it the next day won t affect result the researcher found no word yet on whether it work on brown rice or if other

believe we do owe it to a soldier to get them ready and get em introduced to something on the outside so they can at least begin that conversation herd said the preparation piece is the easy part the hard part is the connection piece i m excited about where opportunity knox because it connects them not just to a job but to a community the feeling is mutual for kentucky s business community where opportunity knox is a portal to a pool of reliable skilled worker that they say would otherwise be lacking a economic developer workforce is a challenge said eileen pickett an economic consultant and co founder of where opportunity knox we have this ongoing problem and certainly now since we ve gotten past the recession we re starting to see growth and we need people with the right skill the

pickett insist for one thing a person must be healthy free of a criminal record and have completed high school to get into the army in the first place soldier then learn concrete skill in the army that often translate into civilian occupation everything from truck driving to supply chain management to computer science but more valuable than the skill the army teach soldier are the attribute that service instills herd said soldier are virtually guaranteed to develop discipline a collaborative spirit and an ability to think on their foot before they emerge from fort knox s wall to return to the civilian world and those are often the intangible quality that make people reliable employee and innovator the military is pretty much a pre screening event for employer because all employer want the same people right they graduated school they re healthy they stay out of trouble herd said so we take those people and we train them and discipline them and mature them and we steal them for a few year and then we give them back to society the military is pretty much a pre screening event for employer because all employer want the same people right they graduated school they re healthy they stay out of trouble retired col walter herd director army transition assistance program the visit to an army base that inspired a new initiative pickett got the idea for the program after taking a group tour of fort irwin the army s training center in california there she saw the life size replica of entire town in afghanistan and iraq that soldier trained in before being deployed to war zone overseas it is the crucible that turn young high school graduate into hardened adult ready to face unknown physical and mental challenge in a foreign nation what wa so striking to me this wa really my first kind of up close with the military i remember this captain who told u their job is to make every soldier that come through there have their worst day in the service happen at fort irwin so it doesn t happen somewhere else pickett said to pickett it wa obvious that any soldier that underwent training at that base let alone the experience that followed would make for terrific employee and member of the community if they could make it through fort irwin wouldn t they make a superb supply chain manager for ups i wish every american could go through there pickett said i wa just inspired by it daniel marans eileen pickett an economic consultant co founded where opportunity knox translating army speak to corporate speak given how intuitively appealing these veteran sound a employee one would think veteran would have a relatively low unemployment rate but unemployment among young post 9 11 veteran ha been higher than among their non veteran peer in 2014 the unemployment rate among post 9 11 veteran wa 7 2 percent compared with 6 percent among non veteran for post 9 11 veteran age 18 to 24 the jobless rate wa 16 2 percent compared with 12 5 percent among non veteran of the same age the figure have since declined but on the advice of the bureau of labor statistic we are using annual data here for greatest possible accuracy the reason are complicated the high incidence of post traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury among returning iraq and afghanistan veteran no doubt play a role though that may be more due to employer stigma about the condition than their actual effect there are other factor however that have more to do with the military s separation from civilian society the network that soldier rely on to advance in the military often do not extend into the civilian world a a result it is hard to make professional connection with peer in the civilian world that are so essential to finding a job in today s economy herd belief that departing

translating those skill from army navy speak to corporate speak and explaining how military service specific skill are universally applicable in fact those with the most easily translatable skill often have a harder time realizing the value of the attribute they have honed in the military let alone communicating them in term employer can easily grasp herd note that machine gunner and

microbiota are the trillion of microorganism living in our intestine that help keep our metabolism immune system and other bodily function running normally explained senior study author jonathan cedernaes a sleep researcher at uppsala university in sweden mounting evidence ha linked an unhealthy gut microbiota with inflammatory bowel disease allergy neurodegenerative disease and metabolic

followed nine individual who spent two night sleeping in a lab for eight and a half hour and then another two night of sleeping in a lab for only four and a half hour the study included a fairly small number of people but the strength behind the data is that the researcher were able to compare the effect of varied sleep level on gut bacteria within the same individual plus they only included subject who reported having gotten consistent sleep and regularly timed meal the week before the study which meant everyone s gut bacteria started out at a somewhat typical level the data showed that getting le sleep didn t necessarily change which gut bacteria the individual had but getting le sleep did change the level of specific strain of bacteria the amount of certain type of bacteria decreased by nearly 50 percent and that wa after only two night of not getting enough sleep the finding wa significant because the wrong balance of bacteria in our gut is thought to be one of the big factor that cause obesity in some individual cedernaes explained what s more the ratio of specific strand of gut bacteria observed after individual had not gotten a full night s sleep mirrored the

a young age and the castle staff said his cruel father kept him away from her while she wa on her deathbed therefore they feel responsible for his behavior because they never protected him from his

they re not actually new lyric they re actually howard ashman s that were outtake thing menken told comicbook prior to the premiere in los angeles we had also put some of the outtake lyric from howard in the broadway show and the reason that they hadn t been used in the animated wa that they were quite edgy for example the added lyric i hunt i sneak up with my quiver and i shoot in the liver wa too edgy for an animated film but for this one menken said it wa perfect unlike in the original the new beast is highly educated boasting about his expensive education while quoting shakespeare and critiquing belle s admiration for romeo and juliet this is a sharp contrast from the original movie where a bored and seemingly illiterate beast needed belle s help sounding out word in the book the beast is anything but bored with the book and agrees with belle that his huge library really is wonderful the beast doesn t need any help reading a book and belle even catch his reading a romance alone in the garden at one point what happened to mr potts child chip s brother and sister while chip nathan mack ha always been front and center it wa made clear in the 1991 movie that he wasn t

approach the path to the beast s castle he discovers a tree that had been knocked down by lightning standing upright again gaston and lefou exchange glance implying that maurice ha lost it and tell him it s time to turn around but maurice refuse explaining that they should head toward the right gaston loses his temper with maurice and say he only entertained maurice s wild story because he want to ask for his daughter s hand in marriage when maurice say that will never happen gaston realizes maurice will just get in his way so he knock him out and tie him to a tree leaving him to the wolf lefou clearly uncomfortable with the idea of leaving maurice for dead pleads with gaston to reconsider but gaston push forward and return to town without maurice little doe he know maurice will beat him back to town telling local the story about how gaston left him there to die if only they believed him the live action beauty and the beast remake made history by featuring disney s first ever

will roll their eye at you and change the subject to something le divisive like immigration policy would a buffy the vampire slayer by any other name have been a crossover hit rather than a cult classic or won more award or simply have been an easier sell to non fan certainly you can imagine wb executive thinking that which is why they briefly tried to get joss whedon to shorten the title to just slayer whedon held firm and not just because it might have created confusion between the show and the thrash band that brought the world song like reign in blood and mandatory suicide he knew that buffy the vampire slayer wa the perfect title for his series because it captured the exact spirit of what he wa planning to make you could give it a more serious or distinguished title but no matter the packaging the show inside would be about a vapid teenage girl buffy summer sarah michelle gellar who discovered that her destiny wa to protect humankind from vampire demon and other creature of the underworld and a show whose tone shifted rapidly between horror melodrama action and pure comedy the name tell you all of that and suggests that if you re turned off by it you re probably not going to like the series to which it s applied it wa a tonal balance that director fran rubel kuzui didn t even bother attempting with the campy buffy movie adapted from whedon s first script the show though would have room for many different emotion all juggled expertly by gellar anthony stewart head alyson hannigan and the rest of the cast it wa a series made cheaply even by the

a monster but laconic guitar player oz seth green actually transformed into a werewolf every time the moon wa full turning monster into metaphor for teenage emotional turmoil wa a clever gambit and one that played particularly well during the show s three season set in high school buffy is by our ranking anyway one of the best tv show ever set in high school but it wasn t entirely immune to the same problem that eventually beset all such show when their character head to college even so those later season still had a knack for landing on the right parallel between the supernatural and the universal like buffy s little sister dawn michelle trachtenberg literally being put on earth to cause her problem which in this case involved the literal end of the world those later year also offered some thrilling formal experiment including hush an homage to silent horror movie involving demon who rob people of the ability to speak or scream the body a stripped down outing where buffy confronts

already in your kitchen from chili to mustard how to turn 8 classic ingredient into bulge beating superfoods", "context": "you might be familiar with the notion that eating food that are high in calorie along with a lack of physical activity cause an imbalance in metabolism which lead to obesity the tricky thing for many of u is getting the balance right and ensuring we maintain a healthy weight however the metabolism is not always an easy thing to understand and differs from person to person varying in efficiency and requiring differing amount of energy to process the food and drink consumed wouldn t it be fabulous to be able to eat food that can help you lose weight simply by eating them although this doesn t quite make sense on first reading you may be surprised to know that there really are food that can help you do just that research suggests that there are some food that may help manage weight by boosting the metabolism due to their thermogenic effect on the body in other word the amount of energy used and heat produced a your body process this food all food when consumed speed up the action of the muscle in the digestive tract using up energy and producing heat in the process this is known a thermogenesis however certain food use up more energy and create more heat a the body burn calorie the harder the food is to digest the more calorie the body will have to burn to fully break it down before it can absorb the nutrient from it thermogenesis kick in after every meal and the digestive process continue to burn calorie many hour after a meal is eaten the thermogenic effect of food will depend upon the type of food and the amount of food consumed in the diet a a whole an effective weight loss programme can be modified to include some of these thermogenic food to help you to achieve your goal but it is important to remember that this effect will only be achieved a part of a balanced diet with this in mind here are eight food that can have a thermogenic effect on your body 1 chili pepper capsaicin a compound in chilli pepper stimulates the body to burn energy and create heat in our body white fat cell store energy and brown fat cell are thermogenic producing heat by burning fat a 2015 study suggested that increasing capsaicin in the diet may stimulate thermogenesis and also induce white fat cell to behave like thermogenic brown fat cell use fresh chili chilli flake or cayenne powder to add flavour to marinade and dressing or simply sprinkle liberally on your meal 2 whole grain and vegetable complex carbohydrate such a brown rice oat and quinoa also high in protein are high in dietary fibre that the gut cannot fully digest and break down the extra effort the body ha to put in requires extra energy burning it energy store to digest these indigestible food it is no surprise that any weight loss programme will encourage eating high portion of vegetable and in particular the leafy green such a spinach rocket watercress kale and cabbage these vegetable are all high in insoluble fibre a with complex carbohydrate these will have a thermic effect on the body a more energy is used up in an attempt to digest these indigestible compound so aim to reach your seven a day of which five are vegetable and a maximum of two are fruit choose fruit with high fibre content such a apple or pear 3 black pepper piperine a compound found in black pepper ha a thermic effect and can be responsible for the breakdown of some fat cell so reaching for the black pepper not only offer the benefit of it thermic effect but also add extra flavour to your meal 4 ginger ginger also contains capsaicin responsible for it fiery flavour eating ginger fresh or powdered in your food can speed up the metabolism due to the increased heat production study also suggest that ginger can reduce feeling of hunger and may help to manage weight use it in stir fry curry and marinade or try a warming ginger tea slice into thick disc and add hot water and allow it to steep for 10 minute ginger can also be grated from frozen or stored in the freezer already sliced ready to use in a tea 5 garlic like ginger garlic with it fiery kick contains compound that can enhance thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue use extra clove if you enjoy the taste and include in marinade and dressing for a flavour boost 6 mustard mustard contains compound found in other spicy food and in particular capsaicin that not only give it it characteristic flavour but also can also help to increase the body temperature when eaten add in a teaspoon of mustard to your salad dressing or include it in a casserole for added flavour 7 green tea study show that both caffeine and catechin polyphenols micronutrient found in green tea can help to stimulate the metabolism boosting the number of calorie used by the body therefore it can promote weight loss when combined with a healthy balanced diet and increased physical activity 8 protein when compared to fat and carbohydrate eating a meal high in protein ha a bigger thermic effect protein are complex nutrient and will require more energy to break them down a part of the digestive process for example if you eat a chicken breast containing 300 calorie around 30 percent i e 100 calorie will be burned during digestion research ha shown that eating a high protein diet lead to lower weight gain in part also due to it positive effect on post meal hunger and desire to eat always ensure good protein with every meal or snack not only for it thermogenic effect but also to help you stay full vegetarian

the day when kid could play on their own without someone posting a video online to shame their parent or calling the police to have mom arrested and the child seized by social service only in the past decade or so ha no child left alone become the social and legal norm in the u s a doctoral student in cognitive science at the university of california at irvine thomas is the lead author of a recently published study designed to understand what s going on after all under most circumstance the objective risk to child left by themselves is extremely low the chance that a stranger will abduct and kill or not return a child the great fear driving the new norm is about 0 00007 per cent or one in 1 4 million annually it s much more dangerous to drive a child somewhere or even to walk with one across a parking lot than to leave a kid alone in a well ventilated car news report and crime show feed exaggerated fear thomas and her co author note that legal norm needn t follow inaccurate belief about risk the fact that many people irrationally fear air travel doe not result in air travel being criminalized they write parent are not arrested for bringing their child with them on airplane in contrast parent are arrested and prosecuted for allowing their child to wait in car play in park or walk through their neighbourhood without an adult they note indeed parent safely make decision every day without thinking about other tiny risk when you decide to park your car in a parking lot you don t look up at the roof to see if a sniper could hit you thomas say you don t think about whether the store you re taking your child into might get held up nor should you yet leaving your kid alone even for a short time in safe circumstance can lead to a child abuse investigation what s going on the researcher suspected that the overestimating of risk reflects moral conviction about proper parenting to separate the two instinct they created a series of survey asking participant to rate the danger to child left alone in five specific circumstance a 2 1 2 year old at home for 20 minute eating a snack and watching frozen for instance or a 6 year old in a park about a mile from her house for 25 minute the reason for the parent s absence were varied randomly it could be unintentional for work to volunteer for charity to relax or to meet an illicit lover because the child s situation wa exactly the same in all the intentional case the risk should also be identical asked what the danger might be participant listed the same one in all circumstance with a stranger harming the child the most common followed by an accident the unintentional case might be slightly more dangerous because parent wouldn t have a chance to make provision for their absence such a giving the child a phone and emergency instruction or parking the car in the shade but survey respondent didn t see thing this way at all a mother s unintentional absence wa seen a safer for the child than a mother s intentional absence for any reason and a mother s work related absence wa seen a more dangerous than an unintentional absence but le dangerous than if the mother left to pursue an illicit sexual affair they write the same wa true for father except that respondent rated leaving for work a posing no greater danger than leaving unintentionally moral disapproval informed belief about risk that wa true even when the survey explicitly separated the two factor first asking participant to rate leaving the child from 1 nothing wrong to 10 highly unethical immoral people rated the risk higher when they first made a moral judgment people don t only think that leaving child alone is dangerous and therefore immoral the researcher write they also think it is immoral and therefore dangerous that is people overestimate the actual danger to child who are left alone by their parent in order to better support or justify their moral condemnation of parent who do so the result is a feedback loop that increase the legal and social penalty for leaving kid alone and reinforces the belief that even the briefest parental absence amount to child abuse these belief don t just affect busybody they lead police prosecutor judge and juror to overestimate risk take what happened to julie koehler she left her three daughter age 8 5 and 4 watching a video in the minivan while she went into an evanston

clinton is a hawk and warmonger people often point to her vote in 2002 for going to war in iraq and her enthusiasm for it after all it wa during her husband s presidency that toppling the regime of saddam hussein became the official policy of the united state but her track record of starting and supporting war and siding with despot is much deeper than iraq she supported the coup in honduras in 2009 and in ukraine in 2014 wa the leading advocate of the u s and nato intervention in libya that turned that economically advanced nation into a hub for all type of terrorist group laughed shamelessly at the news of muammar ghaddafi s murder supported extra judicial assassination by drone backed escalation of the war in afghanistan ordered by president obama and ha taken an extremely hawkish stance toward russia and a secretary of state she supported massive sale of advanced u weapon to saudi arabia and it ally in the persian gulf area all reactionary dictatorship the same weapon that are being used to attack yemen the only accomplishment that she is still lacking are starting a war with iran and invading syria if she is elected president she may get to add both to her impeccable track record of war bloodshed and destruction and in the process spark world war iii if it ha not already begun a a result of u policy toward the middle east clinton considers syria and iran closely linked in fact most objective expert and analyst do believe that the war in syria ha a lot to do with iran it strategic alliance with syria it use of syrian territory to help the lebanese hezbollah and more generally what the sunni arab regime of the region consider a the shiite crescent the alliance between the shiite in iran iraq syria saudi arabia bahrain and lebanon so before the war began in syria in 2011 she supported secret negotiation between israel and syria a a way of separating the latter from iran but the negotiation failed a they always do due to israel s intransigence thus to her destroying syria in order to topple bashar al assad became the pathway for attacking iran which she view a necessary for israel s sake a the clinton have deep connection to israel and it lobby in the united state her advocacy of direct u intervention in syria began carefully one of her top aide ann marie slaughter who wa director of policy planning at the state department from 2009 2011 published a piece in the new york time in february 2012 advocating foreign military intervention in syria clinton herself became a leading force in putting together the so called friend of syria group consisting of several western nation and the very arab regime that despise iran and have played the most important role in keeping the war continuing in syria namely saudi arabia qatar united arab emirate and jordan a well a turkey the group is similar to the contact group on libya also known a friend of libya which consisted essentially of the same country and wa created to help the opposition force in libya in 2011 and we all know what that help led to but hillary clinton ha gone even further in an interview with the cnn she claimed syria and iran a well a russia helped creating the daesh saying isi wa primarily the result of the vacuum in syria caused by assad first and foremost aided and abetted by iran and russia despite clinton s skepticism about a nuclear agreement with iran p5 1 and iran signed the historic nuclear agreement in july 2015 after iran made many significant concession after the nuclear accord the hope wa that rapprochement between iran and the united state would slowly develop at the same time it became crystal clear to practically everyone from the president and his vice president joe biden to even the editor of the new york time that saudi arabia and it ally are the main sponsor of terrorism in the middle east they are also raping the poor nation of yemen with u logistic and military support yet hillary clinton is still singing the same old worn out song and espousing the same failed policy toward iran more sanction more military threat and more diplomatic pressure this is of course neither new nor surprising along with the neocon the clinton have always been iran s number one enemy in the u political establishment the cliche in the west is that it is iran that doe not want improved relation with the west that is not true at least not when iranian reformist moderate and pragmatist have been in power three time over the past 20 year the iranian reformist and moderate have tried to improve the relation between their nation and the united state and in each case the clinton have either prevented the rapprochement or a it is happening now try to scuttle it in may 1995 former iranian president akbar hashemi rafsanjani considered a pragmatist then but allied firmly with the reformist now made a gesture of reconciliation toward the u by awarding the american oil company conoco a major contract to develop a large offshore oil field in the persian gulf although a european oil company had actually won the bidding for the contract but instead of responding in kind bill clinton imposed total trade embargo on iran in 1996 a part of his absurd and ultimately failed dual containment policy according to which both iran and iraq were supposed to be contained and put in a strategic box then in 1998 former reformist president proposed dialogue among civilization a a cautious approach to open dialogue between the two nation not only had khatami won the presidential election in 1997 in a landslide his ally would sweep the first nationwide election for city council in fall of 1998 and for the majles iranian parliament in february 2000 but once again instead of making a major gesture toward iranian democrat by lifting the economic sanction or at least suspending them bill clinton announced that iran could export pistachio carpet and caviar to the united state a if that would impress any iranian the clinton administration claimed that it wa seriously seeking formal dialogue with iran but khatami wa not interested unless major sanction against iran would first be lifted which were not after hillary clinton wa elected a senator from new york in 2000 she supported every resolution by congress imposing unilateral sanction on iran all such sanction are illegal because they have not been approved by the united nation security council a secretary of state mr clinton took the lead in putting together a coalition of western nation that imposed the toughest sanction in history on iran the sanction hurt the life of ten of million of ordinary iranian now that she is running for president again clinton s campaign brag about her role in putting in place the sanction a she doe in her memoir a secretary of state hard choice in an interview with abc in 2008 when mr clinton wa running for president she wa asked what she would do if iran attacked israel with nuclear weapon to which she responded i want the iranian to know that if i m the president we will attack iran in the next 10 year during which they might foolishly consider launching an attack on israel we would be able to totally obliterate them emphasis mine iran did not and doe not have nuclear weapon and clinton knew it but she did not even declare that if iran attacked israel which is highly unlikely if not impossible unless israel attack first she would defend israel her threat to obliterate iran a very large country can be accomplished by only one mean attacking iran with nuclear weapon even though clinton s most important accomplishment a secretary of state namely attacking libya under the guise of humanitarian intervention which wa nothing but naked military aggression ha been a total catastrophe in interview with the bbc and voice of america in october 2011 she claimed that iran is moving toward a military dictatorship while the leader of iran s green movement a democratic and peaceful movement that emerged after iran s fraudulent presidential election of june 2009 rejected any u help clinton said in the interview that if they had asked for help the u wa prepared to help them the way it helped libyan rebel in other word the u would have tried regime change in iran although hillary clinton claim that she support the nuclear accord with iran she never miss a chance to demonize and belittles iran in a speech at the brookings institution last september clinton declared i don t see iran a our partner in implementing this agreement i believe iran is the subject of the agreement emphasis mine a if iran is a banana republic that is subject to u will in an article in thejewish journal she threatened iran again we have to send iran an unequivocal message there can be no doubt in tehran that if iran s leader violate their commitment not to seek develop or acquire any nuclear weapon the united state will stop them they will test our resolve with action like their provocative ballistic missile test for which we should impose new sanction designation they need to understand that america will act decisively if iran violates the nuclear agreement including taking military action if necessary emphasis added clinton s rhetoric regarding iran even after the nuclear accord only creates trouble for the administration of president hassan rouhani in the midst of his fierce power struggle with tehran s hardliner by taking a hardline toward the nuclear agreement and improved relation with iran hillary clinton is a strong ally of iranian hardliner who also do not want any rapprochement with the united state in addition to constantly demonizing iran hillary clinton is always looking for way of imposing new economic sanction on iran to carry favor with the pro israel lobby and it rich donor for example it is well known that iranian hardliner were and still are opposed to the nuclear agreement with p5 1 just a the neocon and the extreme right in the united state opposed it and still do so the iranian hardliner have tried to demonstrate their unhappiness with the nuclear accord and one way of doing so in addition to creating other problem for the rouhani administration ha been testing ballistic missile the missile are purely defensive weapon meant to deter israel and the test unlike what the opposition to the nuclear accord in the united state claim do not violate un security council resolution 2231 that wa issued after the nuclear accord to endorse it despite these glaring fact after the missile test mr clinton quickly called for new sanction against iran during the primary season the clinton campaign slammed senator sander suggestion that the u and iran should have closer relation jake sullivan hillary clinton s senior policy adviser said on january 21 this proposal by sander to more aggressively normalize relation and to move to warm relation with iran not only break with president obama s policy it break with the sober and responsible diplomatic approach that s been working for the united state this is not surprising hardliner everywhere are ally of each other and feed one another and clinton and tehran s hardliner are no exception not only doe hillary clinton not want improved relation with iran she ha been itching to find an excuse start a war with that nation and thus she constantly demonizes iran but in addition to demonizing iran she also lie about that nation brazenly for example similar to benjamin netanyahu she always refers collectively to iran daesh and the palestinian group hamas a if they are ally iran ha been fighting daesh in both syria and iraq iran cut off it financial aid to hamas after that organization refused to back bashar al assad in syria there is absolutely no relation between hamas and daesh in fact many senior israeli officer have made it clear that they prefer hamas to run gaza because the alternative would be either daesh or one of the terrorist group allied with it why is mr clinton so anti iran i can think of at least two reason one is that hillary clinton ha never given up her imperial ambition to reshape the middle east because she belief in american exceptionalism and always speaks about american global leadership which only mean world dominance she see iran a an impediment to her ambition for the middle east why doe she want to reshape the middle east and possibly change the border this brings u to the second reason for her being anti iran clinton is an israel firster anything that she want for the middle east is intended for making the region a safe for israel a possible clinton is not bothered by the fact that israel is run by the far right with expansionist ambition to see this all one ha to do is listening to her speech at the annual meeting of aipac in march when asked during her first democratic presidential debate last october which enemy are you most proud of hillary clinton included the iranian among them this wa truly disturbing wa she talking about 80 million iranian if she meant the iranian government why did she not say so why did she not make it clear that she meant for example tehran s hardliner apparently hillary clinton considers all iranian a the enemy which is truly disturbing those who argue that we should vote for clinton a the lesser of two evil in the upcoming presidential election are truly misguided yes for decade if not

consumer preference actually being an important factor in this industry for the first time say david it s a simple a the product we re bringing to customer which is giving people the power to choose where they want to get their energy sunshare started in colorado with a two acre project and ha now spread to minnesota and new york the garden range in size from one megawatt to five megawatt and cover between six and 30 acre of land local utility company purchase energy from the solar garden and then community member subscribe to the solar garden and receive solar credit on their utility bill we think we can change the energy industry because demand for a type of power ha never really driven the electricity industry in this country what you had wa more supply side determination based on regulatory process and monopoly utility say david our hypothesis and what we ve proven is that people will change and people making choice with their pocketbook drive change solar energy is beating the cost of natural gas plant across the country right now even the operating cost and that s not even including the volatility premium you d have to price in to a natural gas plant you d be building for 20 year you ve got the economic plus the environmental benefit that really make solar a win win for both utility and consumer yet change is not always easy and david ha had to work against system that have been in place for a century a he pioneer a new way of providing power the challenge are working with utility that aren t really built for this new operating system that come with the renewable and distributed energy infrastructure so having solar and wind farm around the country near the source of where people are consuming energy that s not how this country ha looked at consuming energy previously you re basically going from one of those old do operating system to window xp it s a completely different experience he say that s really what we re talking about in term of the difference in how energy is transferred across the grid managed across the grid consumed across the grid and tracked across the grid it s that much of a difference so you re working with this industry that s built on a do platform with do economics changing that mindset is probably one of the biggest challenge but economics are driving that it s a powerful force a he pursues making solar power affordable and available he s at a unique vantage point to predict how the energy industry will ultimately change in addition to the choice available to people david predicts it will be easier for utility company to monitor their energy output i think you re going to be able to track energy usage so that you can much more closely match energy production to energy demand previously power plant might be operating consistently 24 hour a day because they really can t be shut off you can t just turn off a coal fired power plant for four hour in a day you end up burning a lot more energy a lot more coal for example at nighttime than is actually being used on the system he say so you ll see a lot le waste in the system which overall will significantly reduce our energy consumption a a

pregnant it s possible but rare can a woman get pregnant when she is already pregnant in other word can she have two foetus in her uterus at different stage of development the technical term for this is superfetation in human it s possible but it s very uncommon two thousand year ago that great greek thinker aristotle wondered about this very topic specifically a regard the hare aristotle noticed that when a hare gave birth quite often the offspring in a single litter would fall into two distinct class there would be a bunch of full sized robust baby hare and another bunch of scrawny frail baby hare it wa he thought a though the mother hare had become pregnant and then while pregnant had conceived a second time there wa nothing fundamentally wrong with the smaller weedy offspring aristotle thought apart from the fact that they had not spent enough time growing in their mother s uterus and he wa right normally in human there are three separate barrier to stop a female from getting pregnant again if she is already pregnant the first barrier is the hormonal change after conception that stop the ovary from releasing another egg dr karl explores the uncommon phenomenon of superfetation the second barrier is physical a mucous plug almost immediately after conception a plug form in the cervix and sits at the top of the vagina this plug stop any other sperm from entering the uterus and getting to a second egg third there are physical and chemical change that happen to the inner lining of the uterus in pregnancy these change usually stop a second fertilised egg from being able to attach to the uterine wall even so some animal specie manage to get around all these barrier about 1 to 2 per cent of all pregnant cow show sign of being potentially fertile while they are already pregnant and superfetation ha been observed in animal such a the mouse the rabbit the sheep the buffalo the mink and the australian swamp wallaby superfetation is extremely uncommon in human with fewer than a dozen case in the medical literature a typical case is that of julia grovenburg a 31 year old woman from arkansas m grovenburg and her partner had been trying to get pregnant for three year and had begun to consider adoption of a child but amazingly she conceived twice in 2009 a few week apart the daily mail claimed that in a desperate and final attempt to have child of their own the couple had given it one last try this is a curious use of the word desperate possible superfetation ha been observed in cow i might be old fashioned but it seems odd to me to regard sexual intercourse a a desperate and final attempt to get pregnant it make you wonder what measure they tried before they got desperate anyhow m grovenburg wa pregnant but then thing went odd the ultrasound showed two independent baby each living in their own separate amniotic sac but one wa much larger and more developed than the other a the ultrasound scan mounted up for m grovenburg both foetus seemed to be growing normally and healthily though it appeared a if one foetus had simply started a few week after the other in other word mr grovenburg had conceived a second baby a few week after becoming pregnant with the first now we don t have rock solid proof that this is what happened we would need a series of ultrasound scan to prove that these scan would need to document a series of change starting with no foetus or amniotic sac in the uterus and then a single foetus in it single amniotic sac and a second foetus appearing in their own second amniotic sac after a few week people don t usually get a series of ultrasound scan immediately after sexual intercourse so this kind of hard data is difficult to get but there is some evolutionary biology behind superfetation female european brown hare frequently have a second pregnancy while already pregnant this mean female can have about one third more offspring in each breeding season for human more baby each breeding

bemoaning the influence the social medium giant ha had on publisher distribution and in turn monetization more often than not it s hard to tell whether he want to play with you or eat you now facebook ha an even bigger faster encroaching dog for publisher to grapple with messaging bbc us viber to tell the story of a real kidnapping in mexico by having it editorial staff role play facebook s messenger and whatsapp product now process a combined 60 billion message a day worldwide a an emerging medium messaging is bigger than even facebook it s the most widely used smartphone feature in the u s and it s already taking a bite out of social medium a of the beginning of this year according to business insider s intelligence report the top four messaging apps wechat viber facebook messenger and whatsapp have already eclipsed the top four social networking apps twitter linkedin facebook and instagram in their aggregate monthly active user this rapid growth is also poised to leave the rest of the mobile app ecosystem in the dust according to emarketer more than 1 4 billion consumer were using messaging apps by the end of 2015 that s 75 of all smartphone user and an increase of 31 6 over the previous year and that number ha grown rapidly since a of this week facebook messenger ha already amassed 900 million user on it own at a time when most smartphone user download zero apps per month and a quarter of all downloaded apps are abandoned after a single use user are spending an average of 200 minute a week on whatsapp so this is clearly a medium we should pay attention to but how should publisher and news organization play with it to answer that question we need to grasp what it is about messaging that s allowed it to become pervasive so that we can gain a better understanding of how content could fit comfortably on it why messaging is different text message the ubiquitous kind that are primarily used by consumer on their mobile device more aptly mimic the fluidity of human communication than other digital form the technology embedded in text message sits in the background versus in your way for instance you can respond to a text message immediately or whenever is most convenient for you it doesn t require conversing party to be available simultaneously a a phone call or video chat doe nor doe it assume that people would rather correspond asynchronously a with email text message also offer a better representation of a person s relationship by focusing on long term conversation message are typically organized in a list form that is automatically updated every time you interact with it the people you talk to most frequently and recently at any given moment surface at the top of that list you don t have to manually program and repeatedly update the list in the way you may have back when you added your friend and family member to phone based speed dial or in the way you need to tell facebook which friend are closer to you than others a status that can change from time to time also in the context of the text message thread a message you receive carry the expectation that you will engage with it in this fundamental way messaging differs from push notification or alert which instead serve to simply broadcast information the expectation with an alert is that a soon a you interact with it it go away a soon a you interact with a text message it sits at the top of your messaging list this focus on fluidity and conversation allows text messaging to more adequately fit the demand of our dynamic circumstance and relationship than other form of digital communication to successfully engage with the medium therefore publisher should harness these unique feature that have made messaging powerful cost center or revenue stream publisher will also need to know if messaging offer a clear path or at least a dimly lit one to monetization in order to see how widely they can experiment and whether this new outlet will represent a new cost center or revenue stream while it s too early to tell there are a few unique related aspect that are potentially promising by virtue of it living on your phone messaging is a natural access point to both your social and mobile data by virtue of it living on your phone natively harnessing an ongoing memory of your conversation and serving a the best digital representation of your relationship messaging is a natural access point to both your social and mobile data for instance facebook messenger is aware of your identity social graph location conversation history and more this ongoing memory coupled with the fact that user are already becoming increasingly comfortable with making payment on their mobile device position in messaging payment service a potential facilitator of paywalled content once they set up their relationship with a service like stripe or facebook messenger s native payment feature user can theoretically convert to paying subscriber with a quick text versus detailing their personal and financial information at every point of sale this could make payment via messaging more effortless than they are to facilitate via website this unique access to data also allows for messaging to support personalized and perhaps more appropriate user interaction with sponsor a opposed to simply serving banner ad that may feel disruptive to the conversational experience messaging apps have the potential to serve offer based on a user s preference in this vein facebook messenger revealed that it will be experimenting with sponsored message since preserving a personal tone is essential to the messaging experience publisher and advertiser will likely explore this area cautiously so we will hopefully see more intuitive exercise in commercialization using this new medium for instance since facebook messenger may already know of some service and company you like via the data you have fed the parent platform over time it will probably prioritize facilitating message between you and those company you already trust and may want to hear from on the flip side if an advertiser get too noisy or feel irrelevant you can easily block them from messaging you again editorial experiment before monetizing it publisher need to test the medium itself the most obvious lowest friction way to experiment within messaging platform is to simply focus on them a new distribution point for content that s already been created predictably many big publisher have dipped their toe in this way for instance the economist and buzzfeed both experimented with the messaging app line to push out news alert that include link back to their respective publication for the full story setting up this type of experience is similar to using twitter to alert user simply create an account on a text messaging app allow user to subscribe to that account and either manually send out notification or set up automated news alert while easy and cheap to fulfill this use case render an experience that s closer to that of a billboard than a conversation which is why the economist deemed the exercise a brand building initiative since the user can t really interact with the message at best this experiment s result will be commensurate with the effort and at worst they may mirror punishment by way of a slow release of the entire work of shakespeare over text in taking a step towards experimenting with the conversational aspect of messaging some publisher have run effort like live editorial commentary in this paradigm a publication s staff member chat amongst themselves for instance discussing a news event and the subscribed audience can follow the conversation a it unfolds and maybe even participate in the discussion the guardian hosted a whatsapp chat alongside the gop debate in december and the huffington post ran a similar effort around various news topic on viber another related use case involving editorial conversation is acting out a script the bbc recently used viber to tell the story of a real kidnapping in mexico by having it editorial staff role play using actual quote from people involved in the case a in the news alert use case for this type of experience publisher need to create account on messaging platform and build their subscriber base but this experiment also call for extra time commitment from editorial staffer to write script and or run the live chat it can also require an outside trigger event like a debate to be happening concurrently on another screen that chat subscriber are also tuning in to chatbots while potentially engaging hosting live conversation on messaging apps is resource intensive and limited in it interaction with end user a editor can t scale themselves to respond to every user s question or comment this problem ha prompted publisher to experiment with chatbots to allow user to interact with the news in the context of text messaging a bot is an account operated by software in place of a person given a pre prescribed set of rule a human editor make a bot can theoretically respond to a user in a way that mimic a human response quartz recently released a news app that sends a user a blurb about a story and employ a bot to ask the user to select between reading more about that specific story or moving on to the next story forbesbot on telegram cnn created a similar bot on facebook messenger using the just released send and receive api and publication like forbes and techcrunch have created bot on the messaging platform telegram using bot creator chatfuel purple is yet another similarly powered bot that text user with election news allowing them to delve deeper into a subtopic within a message by texting back a pre designated keyword e g kasich contained within that original bot message powering these experience relies on a diligent combined effort of developing a bot frequently via a third party and dedicating editorial resource to writing short conversational prose out of published story in it current state the news bot is a novelty that more closely mimic the experience of interacting with an automatic phone teller than talking to a human journalist the seemingly endless loop of repeatedly hitting button or expressing keywords in order to get a response to a specific question can leave a user quickly fatigued the underlying problem is that bot are essentially formula created to handle a limited set of scenario within a pre defined framework and they haven t gotten to the point where they can manage massive bank of scenario smoothly enough to handle every day decision this problem isn t so different from why with self driving vehicle we re clearly pretty close to making a car that can handle highway driving with no human input since the range of possible event is pretty small say benedict evans a partner at the venture capital fund andreesen horowitz but driving in central rome or moscow is an entirely different matter that need an entirely different level of decision making what doe that hand gesture mean to handle the multitude of scenario presented in an open ended system like chat we need a far more sophisticated bot that can scalably and quickly run decision based on all potential user input a form of artificial intelligence ai that can more holistically mimic human conversation the current limitation of chatbots haven t stopped messaging platform like telegram kik and facebook messenger from launching their own bot ecosystem nor have they hindered publication like the washington post from creating their own homegrown bot the promise of true ai an interaction framework that would allow news provider to offer each of their user a bespoke conversational experience at scale is far too meaningful to give up on that s why in tandem with releasing it limited scope send and recieve api for bot creator facebook ha also released bot engine a system based on machine learning that can pave the way for more complex scenario like handling different variation of the same user question ai powered news looking to the future you can imagine an ai based chatbot that truly comprehends intention behind language a bot that you can have long term discussion with about the news the way you would with a well informed friend this intelligent bot could also fulfill the promise of voice based product like apple s siri or amazon s alexa it would both learn who you are and understand the content within story enough to surface news you d likely be interested in whether or not you explicitly told it you were or perhaps before you even knew you were this type of bot would be promising in the sense that it may change the current rut we are in with digital news a relationship which twitter s co founder and medium founder ev williams aptly describes a stuck in the idea that the medium people consume is what they want will writer soon share the kind of power and influence over creating digital user experience that graphical designer now have while we don t currently have ai powered news we can start paving the way for it by crafting the right type of conversation based framework for it what s exciting about this for writer and journalist is that the archetype text messaging is based on broadly described a conversational user interface ui is largely driven by exposing functionality through language designing a killer chatbot therefore relies at least a much on using the right kind of language a it doe on a creating a great graphical user interface will writer soon share the kind of power and influence over creating digital user experience that graphical designer now have unlike website and mobile apps which rely heavily on navigational design and button to express breadth of coverage and direct user to the content they may be interested in with chatbots all of your feature need to be reachable solely through word so picking the right thing to say and the tone of your dialogue with the user is crucial explains matty mariansky who created meekan a calendaring bot for enterprise messaging platform slack this new role of language can empower writer to design experience for messaging based service for instance mariansky hired dedicated scriptwriter to come up with more than 2 000 sentence to handle a meeting request while mark zuckerberg argues that the best messaging experience will combine conversational and graphical ui rather than rely on word alone the role of language a a form of user experience design becomes even more important when we start designing our bot to be flexible enough to work with both text and voice when the bot is stripped of a screen altogether a with service like siri and alexa language is the user experience it wouldn t be far fetched therefore to imagine a scenario in which journalist extend their writing skill and editorial judgment to not only cover story but design the channel through which these story are distributed these writer may also be critical to the development of an entirely new bot influenced lexicon introducing new word and phrase into our vernacular and through them new way for user to interact with the news this type of shift the ability for writer and publisher to design digital experience with the same skill set used to hone their journalistic craft could profoundly change their current shaky relationship with digital product and news distribution and in turn with their monetization stream and reader journalist don t have to sit back and watch this bot story unfold there are no definitive paradigm yet so we can help write the book on creating the most engaging experience", "question": "how should publisher and news organization utilize the text messaging medium what is

candlestick or a copy of the declaration of independence there s always that hope that maybe up among the rubbish is something of real value just waiting to be discovered after all what could be better than a climate controlled treasure hunt that dream extends into collectible from pogs to marble to cabbage patch kid most of u tried to collect something at one point or another for a fewm the passion kept going until today a few folk have the kind of pop culture artifact that will amaze archeologist from future civilization for the time being you can probably leave those shoebox where they lie though because the truth is that those old prize rarely retain much value over time no matter how high profile most collection sooner or later become little more than old curiosity remnant of a fad that only really made sense in a specific time and a particular place yet perception often lag when it come to many collection people s belief in their value a an investment lingers long after that cease to be true what drive the kind of passion that can send price for laminated cardstock soaring and what can bring that tumbling back down to earth to understand that it s helpful to look at ten collection that are worth le sometimes a lot le than many people think 10 coca cola memorabilia a jim griffith an antiquarian and the dean of education for ebay explained a few rule guide the price of collectible first and foremost is the oldest of all supply and demand it would be a mistake he said not to ascribe to the collectible market the general rule of market value historically that particular rule hit the market for coca cola collectible hard back in the 1940s and 1950s america seemingly couldn t get enough of coke brand merchandise and the company obliged pumping out paraphernalia from clock and cooler to more exotic fare such a the iconic gas station pump and even flatware set contrary to popular rumor however the smith wesson coke bottle grip wa simply named after the shape not a marketing partnership price soared for even the most mundane of item a collector and novice alike grabbed every red and white tv tray they could this also brought price tumbling back down when those collectible were on the shelf of every single dime store in the country today the more elaborate piece will still fetch a good price such a the vending machine listed for over 1 000 but most of those coke stamped product are now just inexpensive curiosity available for 5 here and 10 there if the seller s lucky 9 americana with americana popular around the same time a coke brand merchandise everyone can picture this mid century craze smallville u s a house decorated from front to back with american flag and eagle in every shape size and permutation americana collector slept under uncle sam sheet ate off of patriotic plate and hung their picture in freedom frame today not so much the frenzy of buying american collectible and american antique from the mid and early century definitely ha taken a downturn griffith said a with virtually all collectible the rule isn t absolute while price will chase fad for most item the really high quality or unique piece will always retain at least some of their value in fact for collection past their prime the truly valuable piece may even go up in value a set begin to fade away a marsha dixey consignment director with heritage auction explained value of a collection ha more to do with the run of the mill piece than the truly outstanding one collection become worthless she said when the majority of it piece become little more than knick knack that anyone can get what thing don t have a value anymore that people think should she said is one of those thing that s totally driven by the collector group that s no longer interested and ha dropped out of the marketplace by the time 99 of the piece are available to anyone who want them it cease to have value a a collection and instead is about singular artifact 8 roseville pottery where supply and demand is a old a the concept of trade itself another major factor in eroding value is something brand new the internet it s what wiped out collector of roseville pottery and it will be back later on this list for year roseville pottery wa a collecting craze while the company itself went out of business in 1954 roseville s work continued to circulate gaining value over the year a it work grew in popularity whether acquiring piece at antique shop or roadside dealer collector prized every roseville find they could claim and a a result price shot through the roof until the internet came along and put a stop to all that by taking the mystery out of the pot one of the thing that ebay and the internet did wa pull the cover off year of false scarcity in the market griffith said suddenly the actual supply situation wa revealed prior to the internet and site like ebay i could go searching in my car to different antique market and shop and it wa rare with the internet i could connect to every piece of roseville in the world what the internet revealed wa how much price depended not just on supply and demand but also on regional supply and demand a piece wa a valuable a the supply of roseville pot that the buyer could find regardless of how many existed in the wide world when the local antique store ha just two piece in stock that can drive up some hard bargain when shopper can go home and google up 800 more not so much 7 thomas kinkade painting another success story brought low by the internet for a period of time in the 80 and 90 thomas kinkade the painter of light wa absolutely everywhere now to a degree kinkade s work wa value driven his painting are legitimately attractive sometimes downright beautiful and he wa doing something with color and warmth on canvas that didn t really exist in popular culture at that moment yet kinkade wa a victim of his own success creating an entire company out of reprinting his painting complete with dedicated franchise gallery across the country and a 110 million ipo in 1994 by it peak thomas kinkade signature gallery had 350 location across the nation before it bubble burst in a slow collapse began in the early 2000s culminating in a bankruptcy filing in 2010 what happened a combination of the two factor we ve already discussed market glut and the internet a kinkade flooded the country with his print the value of the product in store increasingly became an illusion price represented how likely you were to find another kinkade around the block local scarcity a dixey put it not how much the piece wa objectively worth the bubble would burst sooner or later and internet marketplace did the trick once prospective buyer could reach the thousand of work that t k s gallery had been pumping out for over a decade the rest wa just a matter of time 6 hummel figurine most people have heard the name hummel before one of the most popular collectible in american history hummel figurine are virtually synonymous with meticulously sorted row of tchotchke painstakingly assembled over the year hummel first started producing it porcelain figurine in 1935 after the drawing of a german nun maria innocentia hummel after gi s returned from germany in the 1940s bearing gift of these for their wife and girlfriend the collection began to catch on because there wa enough scarcity to create a legitimate secondary market no one could go to the shop and just get another you had to hunt for what limited supply wa out there over the course of the 20th century goebel the parent company that owned hummel decided to break that model endless special edition and limited run proliferated all based on the proposition that piece would continue to appreciate in value hummels were sold a an investment while the very act of selling them in bulk undermined the scarcity that made them valuable in the first place like with thomas kinkade s work eventually buyer could readily find excess product either from the manufacturer or a flooded secondary market the value plummeted and today while some few retain their value most are little more than paperweight 5 comic book if flooded market and the internet have dragged down collection value what cause it in the first place there must be some good reason why otherwise sane people shell out sometimes million of dollar for a few colored picture on musty paper the reason griffith explained ha much to do with emotion it is often he said about a shared cultural moment collection especially pop culture or mass produced work are about the thing we form an attachment to en masse hummel represented the end of the war year while thomas kinkade marketed his painting to space where young couple would splurge on vacation a collectible is ultimately a personal decision that something ha value far greater than the cost of it commodity and price can shoot up when society decides to embrace that collectively there is no greater evidence of that griffith said than the explosion of the comic book industry into both collecting and medium the idea now that our biggest blockbuster are all based on comic book hero is not coincidental to the fact that today s audience were all comic book reader when they were younger unfortunately despite the impression many people have of lost rich in the paperback of their youth the reality is far more mundane aside from the highest value item comic book collection are worth next to nothing these day although dixey disagreed with that arguing that comic book are probably more solid than if you went out and purchased a very fine piece of chippendale s furniture 4 commemorative plate for some reason in the mid century the idea of memorializing shared moment on dinnerware became huge historian are still struggling to explain it nevertheless plate commemorating idea such a the statue of liberty centennial the world series and norman rockwell s painting exploded a collectible often fueled by qvc and late night television the trouble is that with no one company acting a the gatekeeper for any of these product there wa never any market scarcity to begin with unlike collectible like hummel figurine whose manufacturer could have chosen to produce le plate such a centennial and norman rockwell collection were simply stamped out by any company that had a potential buyer although billed a a collector s item these are product that never had any real value to begin with today a the ebay listing show these are all but worthless with product such a the statute of liberty centennial plate selling for 0 99 and most norman rockwell one going for 5 to 15 apiece 3 baseball card card are another quintessential collector s item today much of the collector s world ha shifted to trading card game where the granddaddy of them all magic the gathering can still command enormous value a single card from that game can still fetch upwards of 30 000 baseball card on the other hand frequently disappoint it s not that baseball card have no value a long a the sport remains popular so too will it card it s that they have far le value than people assume while rare or exceptional card can still fetch a bundle most baseball card are worthless the disappointment settle in when people realize the difference between their expectation and reality those carefully hoarded collection from their youth stacked up piece of cardboard tucked away and sat on for 20 year will fetch well maybe the price of lunch the reason go back to cultural moment america simply doesn t have the love affair with it pastime that we once did when baseball resonated on an emotional level with almost everyone collector could sell their card to almost anyone and price reflected that today a interested ha waned so too ha demand those cultural moment change very quickly griffith said if you think back it wa a year or two ago the seth rogan movie the interview and all the brew ha ha about sony picture not releasing it that wa an interesting cultural moment it popped up very quickly and then suddenly there were poster on ebay of this movie which looked like it may not be released which were selling for hundred of dollar today those poster will go for a few buck baseball fanaticism lasted a lot longer and may someday be back but for now few of those card are much of an investment 2 beanie baby almost 20 year ago now beanie baby came along and it created a furor dixey said it started at a price point where people could afford to buy it and then it escalated dixey had a front row seat for the beanie baby explosion a brief fad america practically lived and died on beanie baby for a period of time in the late 90 for many millennials it stand out a the concept of collection a investment turned junk bond and today we still talk about the market for these little plush toy in awe the most expensive of which went for several thousand dollar a slate s mark stern wrote of his own experience shopping for the plush toy in 1999 the britannia bear wasn t just a toy we explained it wa an investment projected to be worth thousand of dollar within a decade our father capitulated and bought u each a britannia bear which we dutifully kept in mint condition with the tag intact reveling in it rarity while dreaming of the day it would be a hugely valuable collector s item one month later the company that developed beanie baby abruptly announced that it would stop producing the toy at the end of the year today the britannia beanie baby sell for 10 on ebay entire book have been written on the beanie bubble but suffice to say that unless you re sitting on one of the princess diana bear priced on ebay at an aspirational 343 000 to 450 000 that collection is worth maybe the gas money down to the salvation army 1 lunch box on the list of nice dream add the idea that the old fraggle rock lunch box you used to use for ham sandwich and gatorade might help send your kid to college now dispense with that notion altogether because no matter how fiercely some people might seek to line their wall with them these product just aren t that valuable i had some experience oh 15 18 year ago with lunch box and bought and sold quite a number of them dixey said there were some that were indeed rare and they were bringing lot of money then all of a sudden some thing started coming out of the woodwork dixey added you go back to the old adage of supply and demand all of a sudden there s a glut of them and it brings the price down one of the biggest question in this space is consistently why people have such a mismatch between value and expectation part of it is simple lack of research but part griffith said is the very human habit of wishful thinking i did a lot of time in the 70 a a picker going around to different home with another antique dealer looking for merchandise to buy and sell he said what wa amazing to me wa how many people thought that what they had wa way more valuable than it really wa and there wa no real way to argue with them nothing to point to today increasingly the bubble is bursting with advent of internet information",

want player of the new game to be abler to make their own decision a to how to play the game this ha apparently worked out so well that there s one major mechanic in the game you don t ever need to touch i had a chance to sit down with both watch dog 2 a well a the game s creative director where i learned that it s possible to beat watch dog 2 without ever firing a gun something interesting is our lv director he finished the game without using the shooting mechanic he used takedown because sometimes in stealth you have to use them but he never shot anyone this is kind of our goal you don t have to kill people and you don t have to shoot can we achieve that sometimes it s very difficult in a certain context but we did it so i m super proud of that actually the great appeal of open world game is that they re supposed to give you a variety of way to attack any objective however quite often those same game tend to push you down a particular path so one game mechanic is important in one mission and another is the focus later on ubisoft ha tried to design watch dog 2 so that player have more control jonathan morin the creative director of watch dog 2 told me that while playing the game without gun isn t easy it is possible instead there are greater opportunity for using hacking in order to reach your goal every hackable object can be hacked in different way rather than just one meaning that you have more control over how your environment reacts to you the addition of rover and drone also mean that the player can get access to more area without actually having to step foot in a place where you might be spotted a a fan of the hacking aspect of the original watch dog but not so much the grand theft auto style gunplay this more wide open world sound much more interesting i found myself far too often needing to fight off wave of enemy with a gun in the first game when i would much rather stun them with a hackable object before they even knew i wa there while my hand on time with watch dog 2 wa limited i can say i also never used a gun christopher morin told me to think like a hacker while playing watch dog 2 to consider how you can use the system to solve the problem that you re dealing with it give the impression that the hacking aspect of the game ha been set up more like a puzzle where the player will need to figure out how to hack the different part of the game in order to solve it however the most important part of making that work is that you have to believe there is a solution based on the fact that you can apparently beat the game using only

continued with a hint that wa more or le an admission during a press conference call promoting the series new season that began last sunday a reporter from mynewyorkeye bluntly asked executive producer al jean where is springfield do you want to tell which state springfield is in so by this point with the simpson entering it 28th season and still officially maintaining the mystery any clue a to where the real springfield is could be noteworthy the simpson family ha resided in the american town of springfield for nearly three decade but despite million of fellow american watching their life every week nobody ha ever figured out where their springfield actually is the town name is extremely popular in this country and the family s creator matt groening ha never quite revealed it true location groening ha actually said in the past that the springfield in the show wa named after springfield oregon but didn t go so far a to admit street name and location were a well in 2012 smithsonian magazine titled a piece in 2012 smithsonian magazine titled a piece matt groening reveals the location of the real springfield here s part of the piece that get into the oregon connection ok why do the simpson live in a town called springfield isn t that a little generic springfield wa named after springfield oregon the only reason is that when i wa a kid the tv show father know best took place in the town of springfield and i wa thrilled because i imagined that it wa the town next to portland my hometown when i grew up i realized it wa just a fictitious name i also figured out that springfield wa one of the most common name for a city in the u s in anticipation of the success of the show i thought this will be cool everyone will think it s their springfield and they do you ve never said it wa named after springfield oregon before have you i don t want to ruin it for people you know whenever people say it s springfield ohio or springfield massachusetts or springfield wherever i always go yup that s right this article led to quite a bit of backtracking from both groening and jean a they then claimed the location of the town still remained a mystery the show responded to the article with a chalkboard gag where bart simpson repeatedly wrote the true location of springfield is in any state but yours jean told jean told tv guide at the time that smithsonian magazine misinterpreted something he ha heard groening say for at least 10 or 20 year jean continued he wa inspired by growing up in portland but it s really an every town it s really funny matt grew up in oregon and part of the simpson were definitely inspired by his childhood but there is no specific state that springfield is in and we will never reveal that secret further trying to dispel that groening revealed the location jean reminded tv guide reader that the simpson movie hinted that the town s true whereabouts are geographically impossible in the movie we say springfield border on ohio nevada maine and kentucky said jean so good luck finding that state when you do you re a true simpson fan for what it s worth ohio ha a city named oregon the state of oregon doe border nevada the city of portland oregon wa named after the city of portland maine and there is an unincorporated community that call itself oregon in kentucky in a way however tenuous all of those named state from the movie have geographical connection to oregon the simpson springfield springfield oregon the homepage of the official website for the oregonian city even claim yes this is the real springfield from the simpson of course even if this is true jean and groening will likely never fully admit it jean continued his answer about springfield oregon during the press conference by saying but the great thing

though wa 5 4 minute this mean that if you line up the 500 couple from shortest sex to longest sex the middle couple go for an average of 5 4 minute each time they do it there were some interesting secondary result too for example condom use didn t seem to affect the time and neither did men s being circumcised or not which challenge some conventional wisdom regarding penile sensitivity and it relationship to staying power in the sack it didn t much matter which country the couple came from either unless they came from turkey in which case their sex tended to be significantly shorter 3 7 minute than couple from other country netherlands spain the united kingdom and the united state another surprising finding wa that the older the couple the shorter the sex contrary to the prevailing wisdom probably peddled by older men why do we have sex for so long a an evolutionary researcher all this talk of how long sex last make me wonder why doe it last any time at all all sex really need to achieve it seems is to put sperm into the vagina why all the thrusting and bumping instead of sliding the penis in and out many hundred of time per sexual session why not just put it in once ejaculate and then go have a lemonade and get on with the rest of the day before you say because it s fun to go in and out remember evolution doesn t care about fun per se it generally only design thing to be enjoyable if they helped our ancestor pas on their gene to future generation for example even though we like eating food we don t chew each mouthful of it for five minute just to make the enjoyment last longer that would be inefficient and so we ve evolved to find it gross play current time 0 00 duration time 0 00 remaining time 0 00 stream type live loaded 0 progress 0 00 00

so long is a pretty complicated question with no clear answer but a clue may be in the way the penis is shaped in 2003 researcher showed using artificial vagina artificial penis and artificial sperm corn syrup that the ridge around the head of the penis actually scoop out pre existing syrup from the vagina what this suggests is that men s repeated thrusting might function to displace other men s semen before ejaculating ensuring their own swimmer have a better chance of reaching the egg first incidentally this could explain why it becomes painful for a man to continue thrusting after ejaculating since that would risk scooping out his own semen a well so what to do with this information my advice would be to try not to think about it during the throe of passion by brendan zietsch

injected into the blood stream of a scientist to remove a blood clot in his brain the film illustrates many aspect of biology perhaps most memorably when raquel welch venture out of the submarine and is attacked by antibody molecule which recognise her a a foreign invader and try to destroy her the antibody of the film look like wriggly bit of string that rush at her and then adapt themselves to the shape of her body for an immunologist fantastic voyage is interesting a it wa made when there were competing theory of how antibody worked one the instructional theory suggested that all antibody molecule were the same but they folded themselves around their target and learned it shape to forestall future invasion before destroying it the alternative clonal selection theory say that there were billion of different antibody each with a different shape each b cell a type of immune cell specialises in making just one type of antibody when a foreign invader such a bacteria enters the body only one b cell will recognise it that b cell would begin to rapidly divide making large number of clone these newly cloned b cell secrete large amount of antibody which stick to the invader and mark it for destruction the instructional theory wa championed by no le a person than two time nobel prize winner linus pauling while macfarlane burnet also a nobel prize winner wa the key proponent of clonal selection the maker of the film followed pauling though whether this wa for scientific reason or because the interaction between stringy antibody and welch made for better cinema isn t clear however they were wrong clonal selection theory won the argument nowadays clonal selection seems so obviously right that it is difficult to remember that it initially appeared to have a fatal flaw scientist knew that the immune system of an animal could make antibody to any foreign antigen in the 1930s karl landsteiner showed that antibody could be made to chemical that never even existed naturally this led to a problem for the clonal theory to be correct there had to be pre existing antibody in animal or human capable of recognising any antigen that might ever exist this would require billion of different antibody and a every antibody is encoded by a separate gene for there to be billion of antibody molecule there would also have to be billion of different gene but there are no more than 25 000 gene to encode for everything in the human body considerably fewer than needed to make the clonal selection theory possible the god problem in several in the 1960s and 70 immunologist were increasingly convinced by the clonal selection theory this led to a race to discover the solution to the problem of how so many different antibody could be encoded it wa termed the generation of diversity or god problem the god problem wa such an important and intriguing question that it attracted many of the best scientist of the decade and resulted nobel prize scientist showed that god wa due to several biological mechanism that people had not realised could happen including rearrangement of chunk of dna in chromosome and deliberate mutation of dna sequence the difficulty and novelty of the science meant that immunologist had to develop new technology and some of these technique which were used to answer fundamental question ended up having practical application perhaps most notably ce sar milstein wa interested in understanding how during an immune response antibody improve and become better at binding to their antigen he wanted to immunise an animal and then at various time isolate b cell to make antibody he could then use these to study how well they bound to their antigen and also sequence the gene encoding the antibody to see how it changed over time in doing so he developed together with george ko hler in 1975 a method that made b cell live forever making limitless amount of what they called a monoclonal antibody milstein realised that their technique called hybridoma technology had much wider application in science and medicine the impact of monoclonal antibody a scientific tool and for the treatment of disease ha been immense because they can be made in large amount and are specific they are used in many experiment and clinical test they have now also become an important type of drug having an important role to play in treating many cancer a well a other disease such a rheumatoid arthritis in economic term monoclonal antibody therapy are estimated to have had sale of u 75 billion in 2013 in an age that demand that science is useful and should be

full house 1987 1995 but they continued to rake in beaucoup buck when the popular sitcom ended their net worth in 2018 wa an estimated 400 million combined how have these child star remained rich when so many of their peer have struggled the twin earned much of their fortune making unintentionally laughable direct to video movie 45 to be exact according to elle their most famous film new york minute 2004 earned a dismal 11 percent rating on rotten tomato and the bulk of those percentage point are probably owed to co star eugene levy yet none of that stopped the movie from collecting more than 21 million worldwide it s the same for much of their video oeuvre which wa largely ignored by critic however their 1995 collaboration with steve guttenberg and kirstie alley it take two did garner enough attention to pull in 8 percent rating on rotten tomato in spite of all the critical panning elle claim that the twin film career raked in a startling 750 million dollar call u crazy but we d trade in every bad review ever written in exchange for that kind of scratch the mary kate heath ledger connection it seems to have been forgotten over the year that mary kate wa somehow linked with actor heath ledger s death in 2008 while there wa never any suggestion of foul play mary kate s name wa involved from the moment the dark knight star s body wa discovered when ledger s masseuse found him unconscious in his new york city home the first person she called wa mary kate twice instead of 911 according to the daily mail when the masseuse finally determined she should reach out to the authority mary kate sent over her security team who arrived at ledger s flat at the same time a the ambulance stranger still multiple news source reported that mary kate refused to talk to federal investigator about ledger s death unless she wa granted immunity why wa she so concerned about being implicated for something did it have anything to do with ledger s accidental overdose on prescription pill her attorney michael c miller denied she had anything to hide mary kate olsen had nothing whatsoever to do with the drug found in heath ledger s home or his body and she doe not know where he obtained them miller said in a statement mary kate s stonewall tactic eventually worked when the dea and federal prosecutor closed the inquiry into ledger s death in august of 2008 the u s attorney of the southern district decided not to serve olsen with a subpoena a source told the new york daily news which effectively let olsen off the hook for any further speculation opioid crisis what opioid crisis the olsens are now successful fashion designer with multiple clothing label to their name the twin offer everything from affordable child s clothing all the way up to haute couture and while they kicked off their career with thread sold exclusively at walmart they really shot to the top of the catwalk when they unleashed a 55 000 pill covered handbag associated with their label the row in 2012 that s right these two helped create a black crocodile leather backpack covered with prescription pill and called it high fashion according to entertainment weekly the must have accessory for the fashionable pharma rep wa the result of a collaboration with artist damien hirst whose pill centric work wa previously featured in some of his other installation called pill cabinet so you should be sensing a theme here is what we re getting at at any rate this ghastly accessory celebrating drug culture seems even more offensive considering mary kate s rumored connection to the celebrity drug scene not to mention ledger s overdose on prescription drug the good news they only made 12 of them so not only were their ill gotten earnings likely capped at 660 000 which let s be honest is a drop in the bucket to their nearly half billion dollar fortune but also there s a good chance you ll never encounter one of these abomination strapped to someone s back in real life mary kate look different for most of their adult life the olsen twin looked like younger pint sized version of cameron diaz but around november 2014 people began noticing just how different mary kate looked compared to her younger self and her fraternal twin sister naturally the plastic surgery rumor flew with some gossip site even claiming ashley had altered her appearance too in 2017 the plastic surgery chatter kicked into high gear again after the olsens showed up to the met gala above where mary kate once again bore the brunt of the speculation it should be said however that the tabloid

much do the olsen twin expect someone to pay for a rare van cleef lighter or a deck of vintage playing card we ll probably never know but we feel that we should point out that version of both of those thing can be purchased at virtually any convenience store for around 1 are the item in their shop actually worth their mysterious but surely exorbitant price or are the olsen twin just trying to give gwyneth paltrow and her annual goop gift guide with it similarly market priced personal submarine a run for it money fuller house remains one pair shy portraying michelle tanner on full house wa undeniably the starting point for all of the olsen twin fame but when the cast signed on to be in the sequel series fuller house the olsen twin were the only one to decline while it s understandable that they want to take their life in a different direction it doesn t seem too much to ask for the olsens to at least make a cameo a a nod to the fan and co star that cemented their life of leisure

for year smoker have been shunned into shameful huddled group a far away from the general public a possible then again mary kate married olivier sarkozy a french billionaire so maybe the cigs and the laissez faire attitude sort of do make sense but what about the other detail page six also reported that guest of which there were only 50 were required to turn in their cellphone before a cocktail reception and indoor dinner at a private residence on 49th street between second and third avenue actually that all seems completely in line for a woman who once said we ve stayed quite sheltered okay fine that wa ashley but you get our point they are living pop culture artifact after becoming enamoured with the few detail surrounding mary kate s wedding olsen enthusiast viviana olen and matt

kate and ashley hiding their face but it also ha other wacky feature like a phone that only take call from candace cameron bure offering part on fuller house and a recreation of mary kate s wedding

the office playing eye spy until they find an object they could attach a personality to it and of all thing they chose a bunch of key each to their own rotom i m trying to get my head around this one because it s just such a strange concept the description of rotom on bulbapedia yes pokemon wiki go a follows so it just turn into white good whenever it feel like it purely for the purpose of changing it s power type it just astounds me that stuff like this manages to get all the way to the game and tv series without anybody going hang on ha anyone else realised this pokemon is pointless but it keep happening luvdisk this pokemon that i could get on board with if it hadn t been drawn by what appears to be an under imaginative child the concept is pretty nice it s a water type pokemon with a fish like appearance shaped like a heart so much more could have been done with that brief than what we ve got there s no fin or seemingly anything that could be used to propel the creature through water and the super necessary circle below the eye is almost laughable the lost potential of this pokemon ha landed it on my list unknown unown the flying alphabet which seemingly ha little function apart from the ability of flight and group telepathy but there s 28 of them regardless including a question and exclamation mark again this feel like a feeble attempt to introduce a new pokemon with not much thought put into it i m just waiting for the generation where they ll add a mysterious set of number pokemon which is seeming increasingly likely vanilluxe another one of my favourite because it s just so awful yes a you can see above it s an ice cream cone the designer thought this ice pokemon wa such a good idea in fact that vanilleuxe is the third evolution after vanillite and vanillish to be featured in the game i find this one lazy because they ve added a scoop of ice cream to resemble the evolution similar to dugtrio dodrio etc and because it wa a terrible ide to begin with and they ve managed to scrape three new pokemon out of it jynx what even wa this supposed to be in the first place a terrifying large bosomed womanhood made for mankind jynx make my list for being just plain creepy cofagrigus another one of those that s just a bit why it s a haunted coffin with four black spaghetti arm and a face on it forehead all in all it just look a bit silly in it description on bulbapedia it say the pokemon life in ruin and can swallow up nearby people well now i m scared voltorb the award for the laziest pokemon design ever ha to go to voltorb this electric pokemon resembles something pretty similar to another element of the game it s just a pokeball with eye dedenne dedenne earned it place because it s so obviously a failed attempt to recreate the much loved logo and everyone s favourite pikachu everything down to the bright cheek and zig zagged tail scream cheap imitation and nobody can replace our pika druddigon award for the most poorly drawn dragon pokemon go to druddigon the colour are pretty nasty and i reckon those blue leaf that are supposed to be wing wouldn t hold the rest of the weight i kind of feel sorry for him being so awkward and all looking like charizard s unloved cousin can t be all that much fun exeggutor it s quite hard to understand what exeggutor is all about considering it predecessor is a row of egg with a name that connotes to egg and then it evolves into some coconut tree what how doe that happen i ve never heard of coconut hatching from egg but in the pokemon world anything seems possible garbodor it s pretty hard to pick the worst of the list a you can imagine but i think i ve found it in garbador it s a literal pile of rubbish from an overflowing black bag yeah you read it right the first time it pre evolution is just a bin bag not quite yet full enough to split how do they get away with this sunabaa japanese version name this pokemon hasn t been released yet but it s coming up on the sun

ll see a ghost or find an abandoned safe it s never the same thing twice though you really don t have any idea what you re going to find or discover well that wa the driving force behind a man named dan bell and his recent decision to explore an abandoned apartment complex it started out a a simple urban exploration video but turned into something much more life threatening in mere moment check out the picture and video he captured and how this attempt at urban exploration wa almost his last he start out his journey in a small alleyway formed by the abandoned building this place look like something out of a horror movie dan had passed by this scary abandoned apartment for a few week and just couldn t seem to get it off his mind dan had found blood and animal part around different part of the property in a previous shorter visit he had also found summoning marking around certain part of the property a with all great urban explorer however this only made his curiosity grow with every step he climbed a ladder to reach an upper level of the apartment complex inside he found what you would expect to find in an old abandoned building trash wa littered through the maze of room and hallway the paint wa peeling off of every single wall while some wall weren t even standing anymore every step he took wa a gamble that the floor would support his weight the remnant of what used to be tenant mail box for their apartment this place definitely fell into serious decay after it wa not longer being used falling debris wa a definite worry while walking through this place it s so old the wood is rotting and won t support the weight it used too it became clearer and clearer that people had been in here after the place wa abandoned apparently tony wanted everyone to know he wa there at one point finding a spot to step onto without the threat of a nail in your foot wa quite the exercise a tense moment came when dan took a step and the ground beneath him literally started to crumble and disintegrate it s a tense moment in an already tense video he wa extremely lucky that the floor never caved in on him during his visit after walking through the upper level for a bit dan decides to climb back down the ladder and tackle the ground level floor this would be a turning point in the video what happens next is something that i would never want to experience dan decided to check out an area up a flight of stair when he reached the top he caught sight of something that just didn t seem to fit with the rest of his surroundings just an ordinary reusable grocery bag right the snapple sticking out of the bag make it seem like it wa definitely put here recently of course someone who ha already come this far is going to investigate even further well damn that s a bunch of

pretty damn intense right this guy is seriously super lucky i don t have a doubt in my mind if these guy would have found him he would be dead this building is definitely in the slum if you watch the whole video at around the 5 07 mark you can clearly hear multiple gun shot ringing through the air in the general area that right there would have probably be enough for me to say it s time to go
